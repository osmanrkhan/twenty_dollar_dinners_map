$20 Dinner: New “Urban Hawker” Market Brings The Flavors Of Singapore To Midtown,https://hellgatenyc.com/20-dollar-dinner-urban-hawker-market,135 West 50th Street,"Urban Hawker (https://www.urbanhawker.com/), Ashes Burnnit (https://www.instagram.com/ashesburnnitnyc/), Lady Wong (https://ladywong.com/)","135+West+50th+Street,+NYC",Urban Hawker,40.7608856,-73.9825548,https://www.urbanhawker.com/,,,,"It was almost ten years ago that we first started hearing about KF Seetoh's Urban Hawker , the brand new, instantly popular food hall in Midtown that makes Singapore's legendary street food the star. Back then, in 2013, Anthony Bourdain was a driving force in the project, and the basic idea was to open a massive ""dining experience"" over at Pier 57, bringing street-food vendors from all over the world to Chelsea. Plans changed a bit. Bourdain died in 2018, of course, and Google, along with the James Beard Foundation, took over Pier 57 . There's now a park on the roof there, a City Winery up front, and, yes, coming semi-soon, a food hall being built within , featuring a long list of NYC-based vendors that is, for now, a closely-kept secret. But Seetoh, who's also the founder of the World Street Food Congress , didn't give up his dream, and last week, partnering with the folks at Urbanspace, his Urban Hawker had its grand opening on West 50th Street, hard by Radio City, Rock Center, and the office towers of Sixth Avenue, for maximum exposure to both area office workers (who are, indeed, back , at least on Tuesday through Thursday) and the upcoming influx of holiday-season tourists. The main entrance on West 50th Street. (Scott Lynch) But don't let that dissuade you, if you’re neither a vest-bro nor a visitor to our fair city from Holland. Urban Hawker is a blast, with a convivial, even rowdy vibe, ample seating and standing counters for eating throughout, a full bar over by the 51st Street entrance, and 17 different vendors eager to feed you. Eleven of the vendors come straight from the streets of Singapore, and all of them reflect that island nation's incredibly diverse food culture, with its strong hits of Malaysian, Chinese, Indian, Filipino, Peranakan, and Indonesian cuisines. ""We never really thought something like this would ever happen,"" Urban Hawker GM Larry Reutens told Hell Gate. ""I've lived here for almost 20 years and to see these hawkers cooking in New York City is unreal. To be with some of these chefs or hawkers or whatever you want to call them, these guys who cook noodles, the same noodle dish, for 12, 15, 16 hours a day in Singapore, standing in front of their wok, to hang out with them in NYC... it just blows my mind. It's like: oh my god, that's the actual guy!"" Almost every dish at every booth is priced comfortably under $20, and the portions, in general, are entree-sized. The obvious move, though, is to come with a crew, get a bunch of different things, and share it all. Here are five suggestions to get you started—we've eaten dinner at Urban Hawker twice already, and also sampled with abandon at a preview party—but know that this is only a taste of what's being hawked here. Original White Beehon at White Restaurant ($15.95) White is one of the many Singaporean imports, and apparently the OG chef here, Mr. Tay King Huak, invented this dish . It's incredible! Instantly soothing and deeply satisfying, it features a mess of slippery rice vermicelli (the ""beehoon"") all sodden in a rich, complex broth that's been burbling away for at least eight hours in the kitchen, and topped with four fat shrimp, a few thick tubes of nubby fish, and some bok choy for a bit of brightness. You can also get it with slices of pork or chicken cutlets, or vegetables and wild mushrooms, or even served Szechuan style. Make this a priority. Classic Poached Chicken Rice Set at Hainan Jones ($17) The early winner for Urban Hawker's longest line award goes to Hainan Jones, a collaboration between Seetoh's company Makansutra and the rakishly be-hatted Raymond Kiang, whose father Joon Toh Kiang put this dish on the map back in the 1970s at Singapore's luxe Mandarin Hotel. Definitely get the poached chicken version—it's always remarkable how much flavor and juice resides in such a plain-looking piece of bird—and, if you can persuade the friendly counter person, an extra jolt of chili sauce. Don't be afraid to pick up your cup of broth and drink deeply between bites. Pork Adobo at Tradisyon ($16) The Tradisyon crew only had to travel from Hell's Kitchen to open their Urban Hawker stall, but their Filipino comfort food should not be overlooked. The Vegan Pancit (rice noodles), Crispy Pata (pork knuckles), and Tinapa Mackerel with pineapple are all solid choices, but we can't resist that bowl of Pork Adobo, starring big, three-bite hunks of jiggly pig belly in a tart soy vinegar sauce, plus a whole hard-boiled egg, and crispy shallots and garlic strewn over the top. My cardiologist would be horrified. Singa Roti John at Ashes Burnnit ($11.99) Lee Syafiq has a hit on his hands with Ashes Burnnit in Singapore—there are four of these halal burger stands on "" the little red dot island ,"" and he won Outstanding Hawker at the World Gourmet Awards last May. Here at Urban Hawker, Syafiq is slinging satay chicken burgers, smashed-style beef patties, fried fish burgers, and the crazy good Singa Roti John, a Singapore-style omelet sandwich piled high with curry ground beef, multiple cheeses, coriander, and a few squirts of a gloppy orange sauce, all set within a super soft hero roll. Do you have a hangover? Not anymore you don't. Mee Goreng Mamak at Mamak's Corner ($12.50) This literally-in-the-corner stall from Shukor Tahir and Rajan Belani has all sort of Singapore Indian delights, from Chapati flat bread with lamb curry to thick Murtabak pancakes loaded with beef, egg, and chicken curry, and a bunch of Biryanis, either lamb, chicken, fish, or vegetable. We zeroed in on the almost neon-red Mee Goreng Mamak however, a platter of Indian-style egg noodles wok-fried with tomato sambal sauce and tossed with minced meat. Ask them to please make it spicy though. We've now had it both fiery and mild, and the former is definitely better. Like I said, that's just a small sampling of what you'll find here. Whenever Wok & Staple opens, an offshoot of Singapore's famous Dragon Phoenix restaurant, get their Sambal Chili Crab. The BBQ Stingray Fried Rice ($17) at Mr. Fried Rice is extremely Singaporean, the lovely Lamb Satay ($16.50) at Padi comes with an excellent peanut sauce, and Daisy's Dream Kitchen features a lively Nyonya Nasi Lemak ($14.95). And if you're feeling flush, splurge on one or several desserts from Lady Wong . The Pandan Panna Cotta ($6.50) is especially sublime. Raymond Kiang at Hainan Jones (Scott Lynch) Some stalls at Urban Hawker still aren't up and running, and most close at some point during the afternoon, for an hour or three, to give the staff a break and retool for dinner. The place has been slammed at lunch mid-week, apparently, and Reutens told us that the nighttime crowd likes to linger and feast, so plan accordingly. ""We get customers who are just overwhelmed by the experience,"" said Reutens. ""Because even though it's New York, and even though it doesn't necessarily look like a hawker center back in Singapore, it feels like it, and it smells like it, and we're all kind of experiencing this flood of feelings, of being with friends and having the same thing we had at home, and it's truly overwhelming."" Urban Hawker is located at 135 West 50th Street, between Sixth and Seventh Avenues (there's also an entrance on 51st), and is currently open for breakfast, lunch, drinks, and dinner. The hours for each individual stall vary. Already a user? Log in Thanks for reading!

$20 Dinner: Filipino Favorite Dollar Hits Brings the Skewer Party to Woodside,https://hellgatenyc.com/20-dinner-filipino-favorite-dollar-hits-brings-the-skewer-party-to-woodside,39-04 64th Street,Dollar Hits (https://www.instagram.com/dollarhits/?hl=en),"39-04+64th+Street,+NYC",Dollar Hits,40.7463337,-73.9000145,https://www.instagram.com/dollarhits/?hl=en,,,,"New York is just getting all of the polished fruits of Los Angeles street experiments now. Last week, we feasted on Dave's Hot Chicken , a California chain that started in an LA parking lot and opened its first East Coast outpost last summer near Columbus Circle. And this week, we got on the 7 train to Woodside for what turned out to be a gluttonous array of grilled meats and other delights at the wildly popular LA Filipino skewer spot Dollar Hits, which Elvira Chan initially brought to life as a food stand in LA in 2013. In New York City, Dollar Hits now commands a corner storefront in Queens. Controlled chaos. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) At the restaurant's New York location, you definitely need to be comfortable with a bit of chaos to enjoy your meal. After some retooling since opening day, Dollar Hits now works like this: The skewers start coming out at around 3:30 in the afternoon and are greeted by a crowd hovering in some semblance of a line waiting for the signal to start self-serving, and then a kind of free-for-all begins, all while food is still being brought up from the back. Some of the items on the skewers are self-evident, others less so (Are those...chicken heads? Hell yeah!), but who cares! Everything is only $1.50 each—up from the eponymous ""dollar"" of a decade ago, but still cheap as hell—so just grab whatever strikes your fancy. Our favorites included the beef intestine, the cubes of pork blood, the chicken skin, the fat sweet sausage, and the battered quail eggs. The skinny fried lumpia sticks are also really good—get at least one of those. The Hell Gate skewer party, $24. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Oh wait, do you want some of the lechon on the trays in the back? Yes, you do, because it's delicious, with crackling pig skin and squishy, fatty meat, but you'll have to figure out how to get one of the extremely busy workers to stop for a second and hack up a paper boat's worth for you. And that huge tray of skinny stir-fried noodles back there, is that pancit, aka Filipino chow mein? Yes it is! You definitely want someone to fill up a pint container of that. A pint of pancit, around four bucks. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Freshly hacked lechon, or roasted suckling pig, sold per pound. This was about $8. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Once you've assembled your too-large meal, bring it around to the cluttered counter by the register where someone, maybe even Chan herself until she heads back home to LA, will total it up for you. The skewers are then whisked off to the kitchen for grilling (outdoor self-grilling stations are no longer an option, thanks to the FDNY), so find a table, ladle yourself cups of vinegary sawsawan sauce, and listen for your number. Dollar Hits founder and co-owner Elvira Chan, who runs the business with her sisters Josephine Estoesta and Nelita Deguia. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The sidewalk seating situation is utilitarian but fine, and what the indoor dining room lacks in decor—the look here is pretty much ""surplus restaurant furniture in a stock room""—it makes up for in customer enthusiasm. Chan told Hell Gate that the scene really gets lit when the sun goes down. ""I am so happy to serve New Yorkers,"" she said. ""Especially at night time. They are singing, they are dancing, oh my god, everybody having fun."" During the day, Dollar Hits functions as a canteen, with a turo turo—""point point"" in Tagalog—steam table, shelves of Filipino snacks and chips, and pre-packaged treats like a bright green, jello-y buko pandan. The vibe. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Woodside's Filipino community has come out in force for Dollar Hits, Chan's third restaurant overall and first in NYC. ""Thank you to all New Yorkers for giving me a warm welcome,"" she said. Hell Gate total for two (though we could have fed three), including tax but not including tip or beverages: $38.48 Dollar Hits is located at 39-04 64th Street, at the corner of 39th Avenue, and is currently open Tuesday through Sunday from 9:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. for breakfast and the canteen, and from 4:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. for skewers. It's closed on Mondays. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Already a user? Log in Thanks for reading!

$20 Dinner: Dave’s Hot Chicken Hits Midtown With Some Seriously Good Bird,https://hellgatenyc.com/20-dinner-daves-hot-chicken-seriously-good-bird,944 Eighth Avenue,Dave's Hot Chicken (https://www.daveshotchicken.com),"944+Eighth+Avenue,+NYC",Dave's Hot Chicken,40.7657643,-73.9831962,https://www.daveshotchicken.com,,,,"Dave's Hot Chicken, which opened in August on a cluttered stretch of Eighth Avenue right below Columbus Circle, is technically a fast-casual, rather than a fast-food, restaurant, meaning that your meal is made to order, rather than pre-prepared, wrapped up, and ready-to-go under some heat lamps. Which is good news, obviously, for everyone who enjoys a freshly made—or, at least, freshly assembled—meal. You should know, though, that the vibe here at Dave's is pure fast-food. The tables turn quickly, the teenagers talk loudly, the logos are everywhere, the surfaces are extremely wipeable, the lighting is aggressively non-atmospheric. And yet Dave's Hot Chicken also seems to be something of a destination restaurant. Literally everyone we spoke with during our $20 Dinner last week had taken at least one subway to get here, coming down from the Bronx, or Morningside Heights, or City College. Apparently there's also a line-out-the-door situation most nights, hence the crowd-control stanchions on the sidewalk. As Yoobin Chu, a young man from the Bronx, told Hell Gate, ""This was my first time. I just wanted to see if it was worth the hype. My stomach is feeling the hot, but it tasted great."" Fast food vibes (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Let's step back for some Dave's Hot Chicken history, which among other things involves a certain Canadian rapper named Drizzy. The ""Dave"" here is Dave Kopushyan, a chef with high-end training who, along with his best friends Arman Oganesyan, and Tommy and Gary Rubenyan, started slinging chicken from a $900 fryer in an East Hollywood parking lot next to his parent's flower shop in 2017. The spot blew up (thanks in part to an Eater LA rave ), the crew opened a few brick-and-mortars around Los Angeles, and just when the hype seemed like it couldn't get any more out of hand, the aforementioned Drake stopped by, loved the chicken, and signed on as a major investor. Boom! There are now 74 Dave's Hot Chicken restaurants in existence, including this chaotic little number in Midtown, the first one anywhere on the East Coast. Two sliders with cheese done extra hot with fries ($16.37), two tenders done medium with fries ($12.99) (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) So why should you care about any of this? I admit I was skeptical going in. An LA import on a depressing block in Midtown? Call me when those cowards at In-N-Out land here, so I can trash their garbage fries. But Dave's serves up some truly first-rate fried bird, served either as “tenders” set atop slices of white bread, or in “slider” format with kale slaw and optional melted cheese. The chicken is all white meat (and halal!) but it’s surprisingly juicy, and Dave’s proprietary dry rub, cranked up spicy as a motherfucker if you want, adds a nice bit of crunch. A word about the heat range. You can choose from no spice (the only level that doesn't start with a hot wet rub) to mild, medium, hot, extra hot, and reaper, the latter of which comes with a waiver absolving Dave’s from any physical and/or emotional pain you might experience while eating it. Hell Gate went with medium and extra hot, and the consensus here is that the former provides plenty of fire and flavor, no need to be a hero by ramping it up. You can order your chicken solo, but the basic (and only) combo comes with well-seasoned crinkle cut fries, which are decent when dunked in Dave’s orange sauce. The only other side dish is some creamy mac and cheese. Real players (us, halfway through our first ever meal here) know to pull apart the chicken tender and stir it into the creamy crock of pasta. Really, you could almost make a meal right there. This is how real players do it (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There are small reasons for dismay at Dave's. Every order, even if you tell them you're dining in, is packed up to go, with single-use containers and utensils stuffed into a plastic bag that you carry six feet to your table and then send off to join some patch in the ocean for the next three thousand years. The potato rolls on those sliders are Martin’s, whose executive chair, Jim Martin, amplifies his terrible politics by giving large sums of money to a far-right candidate for governor in Pennsylvania. Jamal Hoque, the GM, operations director, and co-owner of Dave's, told Hell Gate, “The buns don’t talk.” Yeah, OK. And the corny “graffiti” walls were done by an outfit called Splatter House, which Hoque called “a part of the brand” that does murals at every new Dave’s across the country. It’s a lazy way to try and establish cred. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Hell Gate total for two, including tax but excluding tip and the vanilla milkshake we would have ordered if the machine was up and running: $35.77 Dave's Hot Chicken is located at 944 Eighth Avenue, between 55th and 56th Streets, and is currently open from 10:30 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. daily (332-999-1825) Already a user?

"$20 Dinner: Terrific Tacos, Tortas, and Gringas at Bushwick’s Plaza Ortega",https://hellgatenyc.com/20-dinner-terrific-tacos-tortas-and-gringas-at-bushwicks-plaza-ortega,22 Plaza Ortega is located at 140 Stanhope Street,Plaza Ortega (https://www.instagram.com/plazaortegany/?hl=en),"22+Plaza+Ortega+is+located+at+140+Stanhope+Street,+NYC",Plaza Ortega,40.6982505,-73.9226004,https://www.instagram.com/plazaortegany/?hl=en,,,,"You would be forgiven if you spent the last couple of years biking by Plaza Ortega without giving it a second thought. One, because Myrtle under the elevated line can be pretty hairy, with its ripped-up road and zero clearance for cyclists—take the lane over here for sure—and deserves your full attention. But also, you're in Bushwick, where there are tons of good taquerias lurking in the back of bodegas (and, to be honest, a few pretty lousy ones as well), so if you live around here you probably already have a favorite spot or two. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) From the outside, Plaza Ortega doesn't exactly scream hidden gem, what with the blade flags and giant food stickers sitting at the base of one of those new ""luxury"" residential buildings that have sprouted up all over this area in the past decade or so . Ah, but pull over for a moment and consider this: there's a surprising amount of seating here, both inside and outside, so it functions as an actual restaurant in addition to being a well-stocked market. And, as will become clear as soon as you tuck into your tray of tacos and tortas and whatever else you ordered, Plaza Ortega serves some really terrific food. The market is meant to evoke the welcoming vibe of Puebla. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The owner is Jose Ortega, who grew up in Puebla, about two hours southeast of Mexico City, then lived in Queens for about two decades before moving to Long Island five years ago. Ortega has cooked for a living his entire New York life, though as he told Hell Gate after we feasted the other day, this is the first time he's ever served his food at a Mexican restaurant. His previous gig, before COVID put an abrupt end to things? ""I was working at a place in Times Square for 12 years, called Tonic,"" Ortega said. ""A sports bar right across the street from the M&M Store."" Hell yeah? Anyway, if he can keep up the quality here on Myrtle, those days of feeding the tourist hordes and drunk office bros are definitely over. Fish taco ($3.50), taco al pastor ($3) (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There's a lot going on at Plaza Ortega. A dessert counter stands by the front entrance, with freezers filled with paletas and tubs of ice cream for scooping. You can also get an acai bowl up here, though that feels like a stretch. The market area is festive and fun, with an excellent selection of Mexican snacks, sweets, and sauces. But if you're here to eat dinner, go right to the counter about halfway through the place, check out the menu, place your order, grab the little number sign, and find a place to sit. Out front on Myrtle, semi-shielded by plant life, are several tables, and inside in the back are a bunch of stools in a spiffy new tiled bar/dining area, party music blasting from the TV. The menu is lengthy and appealing, and everything is good, but get the Birria Combo, which features three saucy, stewed-meat tacos—Ortega uses beef for his birria—and a bowl of what just might be the absolute best consomme in town. Seriously: you will definitely want to straight-up drink this stuff. Ortega also makes Birria Ramen, which is just a Cup o' Noodles prepared with the consomme and meat. Gringa campechano ($5) (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Another big winner here is the Gringa, a flat flour tortilla that comes grilled and gooey with melted cheese and piled with your choice of meat. I recommend the Campechano for this beast, which is chopped up beef and chorizo, mixed together, and topped with crisp potato sticks. Dump some of the green sauce on this beauty for an extra jolt of pleasure. In fact, the Gringa is so good I'd say skip the regular fish taco, and the regular al pastor one, and just get another one of these instead. Torta milanesa de pollo ($10) (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The Milanesa de Pollo Torta also rules. This is a big, juicy sandwich, not too bready, loaded with chicken cutlet, avocado, jalapeno, lots of soft, salty queso blanco, mayo, and a smear of black beans. So good. Ortega and his crew also make burritos, Enchiladas Suizas, chilaquiles, nachos—enough variety to keep things lively. Did you just move into that $3,700-a-month apartment upstairs? Oh man, you are set for meals from here on out. Hell Gate total for two, including tax but excluding tip and a very good Mango Chamoyoda: $39.22 Plaza Ortega is located at 140 Stanhope Street, at the corner of Myrtle Avenue, and is currently open on Thursday through Tuesday from 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Closed Wednesdays (347-365-1086) Already a user?

$20 Dinner: Unforgettable Fuchka at Tong Bangladeshi Street Food in Jamaica,https://hellgatenyc.com/unforgettable-bangladeshi-fuchka-at-tong,153-35B Hillside Avenue,Tong Bangladeshi Street Food (https://hellgatenyc.com/unforgettable-bangladeshi-food),"153-35B+Hillside+Avenue,+NYC",Tong Bangladeshi Street Food,40.7080299983627,-73.8032177344877,https://hellgatenyc.com/unforgettable-bangladeshi-food,,,,"Here begins a new series at Hell Gate: $20 Dinners. Good New York City restaurants where you can sit and hang out and eat for 20 bucks a person, including tax, not including tip or beverages. Street food is awesome, no question. From those belly-busting potato knishes that were everywhere in the 1970s (extra mustard please... yeah keep going... yeah just one more squirt, thanks) to the quesadillas de birria from the Tacos Puebla truck that recently started parking under the elevated near my apartment. But for all its merits—tastes great, is cheap, fun social scene when drunk—there's also something to be said for eating dinner while not standing on the sidewalk, probably near a pile of trash, angry drivers honking nearby for no reason. You've heard of restaurants? Yeah those things rule too. From street cart to storefront, on the highway-like Hillside Avenue. (Scott Lynch) From street cart to storefront, on the highway-like Hillside Avenue. (Scott Lynch) So even though the Tong Bangladeshi Street Food empire is thriving, with five food carts in operation around Queens and the Bronx, we were thrilled to read about their new storefront in Jamaica, which comes complete with tables and chairs, an ordering counter goofily tricked-out to look like a cart, and a colorful hand-painted mural of people devouring a mountain of the same food we were here to eat, namely: fuchka. Fuchka are crackly, translucently-thin fried puff balls stuffed with warm mushy potatoes and yellow split peas, then topped with raw red onion, bits of cilantro, and shavings of hard boiled egg. You pick one up, dump in a splash of the tangy tamarind water that comes with, and pop the whole thing in your mouth. It's insanely good. Just a wild, beautiful ride. Popping that fuchka (Scott Lynch) Apparently fuchka carts are ubiquitous on the streets of Bangladesh, but not so much here in NYC. At least, not until Md. Naeem Khandaker rolled up in front of a Jackson Heights Duane Reade in 2018 and had an instant hit on his hands. Md. Asaduzzaman Pramanik, who was working at the new Tong restaurant when we stopped by, set the scene. ""Naeem came to this country around 15 years ago,"" Pramaanik told Hell Gate. ""His ambition was to do something so that he can be more popular, and introduce our Bangladeshi street food to the country. Because here in New York you see Indian restaurants, Thai restaurants, Chinese restaurants, and the owners are from Bangladesh. Everyone from Bangladesh is in the business, but they are not mentioning our street food. So Naeem thought, I have to do that ."" Pramaanik continued, ""When he started Tong the street cart, Bangladeshi people were saying 'hey Naeem what are you doing?' But after a month the line was two or three blocks long. People lining up only for fuchka. Nowhere else in America was anyone doing this."" A visiting college kid from Bangladesh painted this tribute to the glory that is fuchka (Scott Lynch) At Tong the restaurant, you get nine fuchka per order, so if you're with a buddy you'll have to fight over who gets the last one. Note that they were still in soft-opening mode when we made the trip, so the fuchka was not yet available ""on fire,"" (literally) which for sure would have made for a more dramatic photograph (sorry), though Pramaanik was non-committal about whether the flavor was improved by turning the orbs into mini torches. Chatpati, stirred up a bit show those chickpeas ($8.99) (Scott Lynch) There are other good things to eat here too which, in addition to providing a central kitchen for all the food carts—an early morning shift cranks out the fixings of hundreds of fuchkas every day—was kind of the point of opening an actual restaurant in the first place. ""We need a permanent space to ensure our street food gets represented,"" said Pramaanik. ""For Bangladeshi people and not only that, but also for people [pointing at me, a normie-looking old white guy] like you."" The chatpati is a fiery stew-like dish, also popular in Bangladesh, that features many of the same ingredients as the fuchka, but adds chickpeas and hot chilies to the mix. This is an extremely satisfying, easily shareable plate of food, as is Tong's new luchi platter, which stars four soft bread pillows and three excellent accompaniments: beef chaap, which are well-seasoned mini burgers (mustard, garlic, ginger, other secret ingredients); some creamy yellow dal; and what Pramaanik called ""Tong sauce,"" a delightfully sweet cucumber yogurt salad of sorts. Luchi platter ($13.99) (Scott Lynch) Coming soon, or maybe available already depending on when you read this: the puffy rice snack jhal muri, a vegetarian version of the luchi platter, several beverages and sweets, and that previously mentioned, eminently TikTok-able ""fuchka on fire."" Hell Gate total for two, including tax but excluding tip and a pulpy lemonade: $34.81 Tong Bangladeshi Street Food is located at 153-35B Hillside Avenue, between Parsons Boulevard and 155th Street, about a block from the F train, and is currently open daily from 1:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. (929-257-6996) Already a user?

$20 Dinner: The Superlative Rokstar Chicken Now Kickin’ at a Supermarket in Long Island City,https://hellgatenyc.com/20-dinner-rokstar-chicken,42-02 Northern Boulevard,Rokstar Chicken (https://rokstarchicken.com/),"42-02+Northern+Boulevard,+NYC",Rokstar Chicken,40.7520634,-73.921463,https://rokstarchicken.com/,,,,"Rokstar Chicken kicks ass. Located in a pair of shipping containers facing the parking lot of a Food Bazaar in Long Island City (not the most scenic of sites, to be sure), this Korean fried chicken spot started slinging some stellar bird, tossed in a variety of sticky sauces, at the beginning of December. They put up a parking lot, but at least now there's fried chicken too . (Scott Lynch/Hell Gate) The founder and owner is Mark Lee, who ran Spot Dessert Bars in Flushing and on St. Mark's Place before turning his attention to chicken. This is actually his second Rokstar location in Queens—the first, also at a Food Bazaar, has been open for about a year, but it's in Douglaston, and thus like 100 miles from the nearest subway, leaving non-driving people like me yearning from afar. Not that the LIC Rokstar isn't situated in car-friendly environs. Despite a newish, fairly well-protected bike lane on this stretch of Northern Boulevard, the whole area still feels more thruway-and-strip-mall than strollable city street. Yes, there are crosswalks. Yes, they are nerve-wracking to walk across. But Rokstar is only a few blocks from the E, M, and R trains, there's a whole seating area right inside the Food Bazaar, and the chicken is delicious. Rokstar's killer chicken sandwich, $7.99 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""I'm Korean, I came here when I was eleven, but Rokstar is a New York City brand, born and bred,"" Lee told Held Gate before we feasted. ""It's Korean flavor with a New York attitude."" You can eat your chicken a number of different ways here. There are wings, and fried boneless tenders—and, the preferred Hell Gate way, for maximum meat and flavor—hacked up into bone-in bits. The exterior crackles, the interior remains juicy, and, if you get it tossed with sauce, the whole thing makes for a glorious mess. Neat-niks should consider ordering their sauce on the side, for dainty dipping. Rokstar seating, and a bathroom, is inside the Food Bazaar. Vibe was downcast when we arrived, as Morocco was about to lose to France :(  (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Good Korean fried chicken is defined by its light, super-crispy coating, and Rokstar (the ""ROK"" stands for Republic of Korea, by the way) definitely delivers in this regard. But the sauce is pretty key as well. You can just get it ""plain,"" but I'd suggest slathering this sucker with either the Korean sweet chili, the hot sweet chili, or the hot soy garlic. The Cajun garlic and hot Buffalo options are also likely to satisfy. The sleeper hit, though? Rokstar's chicken sandwich, made from fried thigh meat and topped with creamy coleslaw. There are a ton of well-executed chicken sandwiches all over the city these days (Have they surpassed the cheeseburger in ubiquity? Not yet, but maybe soon), and this is one of the absolute best I've had all year. The offerings. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The sides are serviceable. Decent fries, crocks of pickled radish, some interesting puffy cheese balls that were too sugary for my taste. Those kimchi dumplings sound good though—next time! Most Rokstar customers are of the take-it-to-go variety, but the Food Bazaar food court accommodations are comfortable enough. The vibe was admittedly a little grim when we went, sitting down to eat towards the end of Morocco's loss in the World Cup semifinals, but in general this is a fine spot to scarf a pile of chicken. ""We're a growing brand,"" said Lee, ""looking to open stores next year in Manhattan, the Bronx, and Brooklyn, standalone spots and places like this at a Food Bazaar. It's a simple concept: super easy to order, high quality food, amazing customer service. Our goal is to become the Shake Shack of Korean fried chicken."" The new Long Island City Rokstar Chicken is located in front of the Food Bazaar at 42-02 Northern Boulevard, between 36th Avenue and 42nd Place, and is currently open on Sunday to Thursday from 1:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., and on Friday and Saturday from 12:00 noon to 10:00 p.m. (347-988-5553) Already a user?

$20 Dinner: Soup Queen Inception in Bushwick,https://hellgatenyc.com/20-dinner-gunthers-soup-queen-farewell-bushwick,143 Troutman Street,Native Bread (https://www.thenativebreadandpastry.com/),"143+Troutman+Street,+NYC",Native Bread,40.7000787,-73.9295484,https://www.thenativebreadandpastry.com/,,,,"Sarah Khoshaba didn't plan on becoming the Soup Queen of Brooklyn. Sure, she always liked making soup, but up until March of 2020, Khoshaba had spent her professional life in the music business, working first as an assistant to one of the biggest agents in hip hop (""she made me miserable,"" Khoshaba told Hell Gate, ""and the hours were insane"") and then as the night manager at the Knitting Factory. COVID changed all that. The Knitting Factory shuttered for good with the initial lockdown, and, like a lot of us during that strange time, Khoshaba was set adrift. ""I did enjoy that first summer of fun, being on unemployment,"" she said. ""But I'm someone who needs to be doing something."" Enter: soup. Soupqueen BK at Gunther's at Farewell (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) After lots of experimenting and some long nights of tipsy taste-testing with friends, Khoshaba crowned herself Soup Queen BK in September of 2020, set up shop on Instagram, and hasn't looked back since. In fact, she recently expanded her soup-making operations by opening Gunther's, named after her dog , with a menu that also includes sandwiches, some breakfast stuff, and salads, all served from a window at Bushwick's fiercely inclusive bar and event space Farewell. ""So it's Soup Queen inside of Gunther's inside of Farewell,"" Khoshaba said. ""It's a little bit of an 'Inception' situation."" It's also really fucking good. Gunther's has two ordering windows, one facing onto Troutman Street, the other inside Farewell right near the entrance. This means that not only can you get soup, etc., when the bar is closed, you can also use the space, with all those comfy chairs, to eat your meal. Or stay outside in the little curbside dining shed. And when Farewell is open, so is Gunther's (at least until 10:00 p.m.), so you can eat something wholesome and nutritious to sop up the booze. Black Bean Hatch Chile, $5 for small (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Khoshaba serves about a half dozen different soups every day, with plenty of vegan options. A recent slate included such gems as Avgolemono, Middle Eastern Mushroom, Red Lentil, Broccoli Cheddar, Tomato Basil, and Sweet Peanut Butta Chicken, and things like Paella Soup, Beer and Cheese, and Lavender Vichyssoise have been known to make an appearance. It's an impressively large repertoire. ""Some of them are classic soups, obviously,"" Khoshaba said, ""that I would research and figure out how I liked them and then create my own recipe from that. And for others I wanted something different. I love Buffalo chicken wings so I made Buffalo chicken soup. I love crab rangoon so I made crab rangoon soup. Just taking a lot of the ingredients that you see in these dishes and then adding a base of soup. Did I create a lot of soups that turned out to be absolutely horrid? Yes!"" Hot 'n Spicy, $5 for small (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) For Hell Gate's $20 Dinner we made quick work of three of Khoshaba's creations: her robust, vegan Hatch Chile Black Bean; her noodle-y Hot 'n Spicy, which has become something of a signature soup; and her crazy creamy and cheesy Loaded Baked Potato, optionally (though optimally) sprinkled with bacon. These were all delicious. Clearly you can order with confidence here, whichever way your heart is leading you. Three Cheese Grilled Cheese, $8 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Both of our sandwiches also ruled. The most obvious Gunther's go-to, the Three Cheese Grilled Cheese, is everything you want in such a sandwich. It's gooey and gloppy, salty and satisfying, the combo of havarti, smoked gouda, and cheddar oozing out of the panini-pressed milk bread. Perfect for dipping into your soup(s) of choice. And the vegan Gunther sandwich is a terrific option as well, the simple stack of spinach and vinegary tomato boosted by seedy mustard, basil, and a drizzle of hot honey. The toasted sourdough, from nearby Native Bread , holds it all together nicely. You can put ricotta or prosciutto on top of this beauty for two bucks extra, but it doesn't need it. Classic Grilled Cheese action shot (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There are also several eggy sandwiches available, a good-looking rotisserie chicken and mozzarella number, a plate of blistered shishitos, and ""breakfast potatoes."" A full coffee program, using beans by Caffe Vita, takes care of your caffeine requirements. And Khoshaba loves sharing the place with Farewell. ""It's a great location,"" said Khoshaba. ""I do hope sometime soon to open up my own little space, but for now this is pretty perfect."" Hell Gate total for two, including tax, not including tip: $34.84 You can sit in the bar and eat even when the bar's not open (and also when it is open) (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Gunther's is located at 143 Troutman Street, between Central and Evergreen Avenues, and is currently open on Tuesday from 4:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., on Wednesday and Thursday from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., and on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Khoshaba also has a Soupqueen BK stall this year at the Union Square Holiday Market, which runs through December 24.

$20 Dinner: Bobbi’s Italian Beef Brings Chicago’s Famous Messy Monsters to Smith Street,https://hellgatenyc.com/20-dinner-bobbis-italian-beef,228 Smith Street,"Bobbi's Italian Beef (https://www.bobbisitalianbeef.com), Brooklyn Tattoo (https://brooklyntattoo.com/), Brooklyn Crab (https://www.brooklyncrab.com/)","228+Smith+Street,+NYC",Bobbi's Italian Beef,40.6840037,-73.9925388,https://www.bobbisitalianbeef.com,,,,"It's kind of surprising that it took this long for someone to open a new Chicago-style Italian Beef sandwich shop here in NYC. Last summer, we all feasted on the meme-machine series “The Bear,” which put the meaty beasts front and center in every episode. Yes, sales of the sandwich boomed in the city's existing Chicago-y places like Dog Day Afternoon in Windsor Terrace, but as far as we can tell, Bobbi's Italian Beef , which launched last weekend in Cobble Hill, is the first brand new spot dedicated to these soggy monsters since the smoldering dirtbag Carmy had everybody shouting "" Yes, Chef! "" (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) And, oh man, are they good here. ""I make my own beef,"" Bobbi's chef-owner Jason Lux told Hell Gate on the shop's opening weekend. ""It takes me four days."" After all the seasoning and simmering, rubbing and roasting, the meat gets sliced up super thin, plopped back into its jus for soaking, and, when you order it, piled into a soft hero roll Lux gets from that Carroll Gardens treasure Bobbi's Italian Beef . But we're not done yet! Lux's house-made hot giardiniera comes next, all fiery and acidic (you can get yours with sweet peppers instead if you want, but why would you want to do that?), and then the whole thing gets drenched once again in jus. Pick it up and wolf it down. It's an absolute mess, and it's absolutely delicious. Italian beef sandwich, $19 whole (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) And Bobbi's is no one-hit-wonder; the menu here is long and loaded with bangers. The two parm sandwiches, one with meatballs, the other with chicken tenders, which Lux hand-breads and bakes rather than deep fries, are total cheese bombs. The pastrami sandwich is made from belly meat and is a fatty delight, covered in gobs of melted swiss and good, grainy mustard. Chicago dog, $8 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There's a Brooklyn Muffuletta, a ""roast beef ranch melt,"" and, the only non-meat sandwich option, a caprese hero with mozzarella, tomato, and pesto. These things are huge, cost $19 or $20, and can all be ordered as a half or a whole. The obvious move is to split a whole one and get a couple ancillary dishes as well, like the excellent celery salt tots (also baked, not fried), or a Chicago Dog, made with a snappy Vienna Beef frank dragged through the garden. Lux serves a Bagel Dog, which is basically one of the Vienna Beef beauties encased in baked bagel dough. But next time, I'm trying that chili cheese dog instead. Sausage personal pan pizza, $12 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There's also pizza at Bobbi's, though Lux neatly skirts the NYC/Chicago battleground on this issue (a contest we’d always winm anyway) by going the personal pan route. ""It's not Chicago deep dish, it's not New York style, it's not Neapolitan,"" he said. ""You know what the secret is? I actually use the original pans from Pizza Hut."" So I guess it's Kanas style? Whatever it is, this is good stuff, baked in garlic butter, cheese on the bottom and top, with bright tomato sauce, gloppy as hell. Lux, in backward cap, works the Sunday supper crowd (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Draft beer is coming as soon as Lux secures his license, but in the meantime (or instead) get a can of RC Cola, the classic sugary soda that's a rare sight in the city these days. The place is comfortable and fun, too. Lux makes for an affable host, the laminated plastic booths are spacious, the tables feature one-of-a-kind designs by his buddies over at Brooklyn Tattoo (you can buy stickers of some of the details for a buck each at a vending machine by the door), and the soundtrack is 80s hits from the likes of Depeche Mode and Missing Persons. Lux, by the way, didn't just parachute in from the Windy City yesterday to stuff our faces this winter. ""I moved here a week before September 11,"" he said. ""Chicago, New Orleans, Portland, New York... I've been around the block, but someone blessed me with hands that can cook."" And his other two NYC ventures have been seafood spots: he's the owner of the party place Brooklyn Crab in Red Hook, and he spent six years running Fulton Landing in the Dekalb Market Hall before it shuttered during the pandemic. Needless to say, we're stoked that he skipped the fish this time and went full Second City on us with Bobbi's Italian Beef. Lux seems happy too. ""To bring beef to the masses, and the Chicago hot dog, and keeping the Vienna name alive...This is from my heart."" (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Bobbi's Italian Beef is located at 228 Smith Street, between Butler and Douglass Streets (it's the only business on the block right now, squeezed between two construction sites), and is currently open from Tuesday through Sunday from 12:00 noon to 8:00 p.m. Closed Mondays.

$20 Dinner: Olly Olly Brings Some Nice Oddball Vibes To NYC’s Resurgent Food Hall Scene,https://hellgatenyc.com/20-dollar-dinner-olly-olly,601 West 26th Street,"Olly Olly (https://www.ollyollymarket.com/), Urban Hawker (https://hellgatenyc.com/20-dollar-dinner-urban-hawker-market), Tin Building (https://www.instagram.com/p/CkjVMN2uD7D/), Olly Olly (https://www.ollyollymarket.com/)","601+West+26th+Street,+NYC",Olly Olly,40.7516571,-74.0071579,https://www.ollyollymarket.com/,,,,"If anyone had asked back in the middle of catastrophic 2020, if I thought the ""future of NYC restaurants"" would have been the lowly food hall, I would have very briefly taken off my mask to show my incredulity. And yet there I was last week, standing in the middle of Olly Olly , yet another spanking new, ambitiously-funded NYC food hall, my fourth such destination in the past month (the other three were the spunky Urban Hawker in Midtown, the luxe and touristy Tin Building at the Seaport, and the Williamsburg Market Hall , which had to delay their initial opening and already lost one key vendor but seems to be moving forward now). The stools are lower at the coffee bar than they are at the booze bar. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) One theory to the genre's persistence, offered by a vendor in Williamsburg, is that the uncertainty of COVID has people reluctant to make plans too far in advance and, simultaneously, reservations for the city's most sought-after spots are impossible to get at anything approaching the last minute. At a food hall, on the other hand, you can just show up with as many or as few people as you can rustle up on any given night, let everyone choose whatever they want, get some drinks (or not), and just hang out without any pressure to turn over your table. At Olly Olly, the suddenly high-stakes world of NYC dining finds a counterpoint. The food hall has six vendors open so far, as well as a coffee shop and a large booze bar, and is run by an outfit called 16 on Center, a Chicago-based hospitality group with extensive holdings in that city. The Olly Olly library. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) It's located in a small, street-level slice of Chelsea's colossal Starrett-Lehigh Building , once home to warehouses and manufacturing firms and recently transformed by RVR Realty into one of those urban office parks that lure in companies with amenities like…. food halls. Olly Olly is named after the thing you say in “Hide and Seek” when you're a little kid and you can't find your friends and you want them to come on out. It's a pretty good image for our post-caring-about-the-pandemic era, I guess? There's tons of seating at all manner of tables, banquettes, and stools. Once the Basquiat theme park currently on view next door leaves in January, Tom Wickes, 16 on Center's director of operations, told Hell Gate that they'll put on things like concerts, fashion shows, and art ""activations"" in that space, which has a 500-person capacity. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) In the meantime, help yourself to one of the hardcover books from the Olly Olly library, which flanks the Blue Boy grab-n-go stand. Or just bop along to the DJ, who sets up every evening behind the weirdly elongated laptop table near the entrance (and the bar). Other odd touches include the mismash of booth headers, which are either futuristic-sleek or jumbled-wood rustic. That squiggly ass logo doesn't really go with anything else in the place either. But really, it's the vendors that make Olly Olly worth a detour the next time you're in Chelsea. A more motley crew you could not hope to find at such a corporate-conceived entity. One vendor quit her corporate job to deliver burritos in a bucket from her fire escape. Another told Hell Gate that her favorite part of being in a food hall is that she gets to blast Bjork over the sound system. The porchetta stand is run by a former professional soccer player. One chef with a Michelin star is slinging egg salad. Another Michelin star-haver pivoted to pizza early in the pandemic, selling Sicilian slices in an alley behind a punk club. It's a plucky crew, to be sure, and both individually and collectively they bring a lot of energy to a place that, so far, is pretty sparsely attended once lunchtime is over. Which in some ways makes it an ideal lowkey hang in the late afternoon and evening, a chill place to grab a quick solo supper, or spend time catching up with friends. Here's a look at all the current food options, ranked in descending order of $20 Dinner appropriateness: Porchetta plate, with two slides and two sauces, $17, from Pen 'n' Coop (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) 1. Pen 'n' Coop This is the only spot right now that serves actual full plates of food—like, an entree and sides—the best of which are laden with porchetta, that Italian roasted pig roll with layers of sweet meat, lots of fat, and cracking skin. If you're more Coop than Pen, rotisserie chicken is also an option, and is also good, though you'll want to pour on the sauce. Your server will spoon out your choice of two sides to go with—I liked the broccoli rabe and sautéd mushroom the best, but go with whatever looks the perkiest under the heat lamps—and you get two sauces to liven things up. You can also order a hefty ""Veggie Plate,"" with three sides on top of a mound of farro, for $14. They sell a bunch of big sandwiches as well. Pen 'n' Coop is run by Andrew LoPresto, Bruno Molfetta, and Lorenzo Calvanese, who also own Babbalucci and Bar 314 in Harlem. Ploo proprietor Roxanna Mejía with pig ears. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) 2. Ploo Roxanna Mejía and Pablo Rojas, formerly of fine-dining establishments like Per Se and Nomad, launched one of the city's raddest pandemic hustles after they both lost their jobs during that first lockdown. The delivered multi-course dinners in Brooklyn under the name Gastronomy Underground, feasts that came complete with ""liner notes"" about the food's cultural history and a QR-code linked soundtrack of, as Mejia told Grub Street at the time, ""super-raunchy songs, the legit shit that we grew up with.” Mejía is in charge of the music here at Ploo , too, the couple's taco stand at Olly Olly (Devo, The Feelies, and Bjork were in the mix the other evening). She also cooks, and bakes, and runs the register, and goofs around. Rojas works the grill and builds your tacos, and they are excellent, especially the gloppy ""Pjork Carnitas"" topped with chicharron and the ""Tongue-N-Cheek,"" which stars both of those things. There's also a chicken one, and a majestic ""Army of Meat"" version, and bone marrow salsa, green guacamole salsa, and a terrific pink horchata made with rose and almond. As for the meaning of the name Ploo, ""that's up to you to decide,"" says Mejía. ""In ten years, if I don't die, I'll tell you."" This place rocks. You can get three tacos for Hell Gate's twenty-buck limit. Is that enough food for dinner? ¡Quizás! Pepperoni and white anchovy Sicilian slices, $5.50 and $6, from Pizza Friendly Pizza. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) 3. Pizza Friendly Pizza Noah Sandoval earned a Michelin star for his $200+ tasting-menu place Oriole out in Chicago, but his contribution to Olly Olly is more, cost-friendly than that, a pizza joint he started that first COVID summer in an alley behind what was described to me as a ""punk club"" called The Empty Bottle. Pizza Friendly Pizza serves bready Sicilian-style slices, thinly topped with things like sausage and broccoli rabe, squash and radicchio, and ""Sunday Gravy."" I wolfed down a pepperoni slice, which was fine, and a white anchovy slice, which seemed to have no such fish aboard, and certainly felt full, if not terribly satisfied. This booth might be better at lunch, when the pies are at their freshest. Scallion pancake burrito, $14, from Forsyth Fire Escape. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) 4. Forsyth Fire Escape The most NYC-famous vendor here is Isabel Lee and Luis Fernandez's pandemic pop-up hit, Forsyth Fire Escape , so named because in the summer of 2021, they only took pre-orders for their scallion pancake, queso blanco, pernil burritos, and delivered them by lowering them down in buckets from their Lower East Side apartment to customers on the sidewalk. It was a huge hit, and burrito ""drops"" sold out in seconds, but their landlord forced them to cease and desist. Since then they've been selling their creations weekly out of the bodega on their corner and, now, at Olly Olly, the couple is making several hundred each day, greatly increasing your chance of snagging one well into the dinner hour. These are packed with flavor, totally unique in the city's pantheon of burritos, and demand to be eaten by both the curious and the completist. They are on the small side though and, at $14 plus tax, don't quite make for a full dinner, hence the lower ranking here. Yubu snacks from DdoBar: Veal carpaccio, $6; scallop, $6;  spicy tuna ($7), egg salad ($5) (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) 5. DdoBar by Joomak Need a snack? Jiho Kim and Kelly Lam, who received a Michelin star last year for their Koreatown restaurant Joomak Banjum, have got you covered. Just sidle up to DdoBar and choose from among a dozen different yubu, short for yubuchobap. They’re basically fried bean curd pockets stuffed with vinegared rice then topped with all manner of meats, fish, or vegetables. The yubu at DDOBar are fun and, mostly, very good, especially the egg salad one strewn with salmon roe, and the spicy tuna one. Want a $20 Dinner? Yeah this booth, where each of these two-bite beauties will set you back at least five bucks, is not going to cut it. 6. Boy Blue Coffee and Goods Not dinner, unless you just want a premade grab-and-go salad or juice at 6:00 at night (you don't).

$20 Dinner: NYC’s Best New Burger Is in Chinatown,https://hellgatenyc.com/20-dinner-nycs-best-new-burger-is-in-chinatown,242 Grand Street,Burger By Day (),"242+Grand+Street,+NYC",Burger By Day,40.7184773,-73.994292,https://example.com/chinatown-burger,,,,"It took me and my dining partner a few minutes to realize we were on the wrong line the other night, during our attempt to check out Burger By Day. Technically, in fact, we were at the wrong restaurant. I mean, we weren't being total idiots. The awning on this Grand Street storefront in Chinatown clearly says "" Burger By Day ."" And right there at the entrance is an ordering counter. So we joined the line and goofed around with the kids who were trick-or-treating, not really paying attention until it was our turn to order. Turns out we were waiting on line for I'Milky , a bubble tea mini-chain that operates in the front half of the space and may or may not serve good beverages, I have no idea. We were here to eat burgers. Which, as you'll probably figure out faster than we did, are sold in the back, at a whole different ordering area. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There's nothing tricky or TikTok-y about Burger By Day. You can order smash burgers here, and sliders , as well as chicken sandwiches and four different fried sides. Toppings include the usual suspects, and nothing more: onions, tomato, lettuce, pickles, ketchup, mayo, and mustard. Soft drinks and milkshakes round out the offerings. You've seen this menu a million times before. Except everything at Burger By Day is made to order, and everything is excellent. In fact—and in a very crowded field—this is one of the best burger newcomers of the year. Hot chick burger, $10. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The fries and tots are terrific, all salty, fluffy, and crisp. The chicken is remarkably juicy and, if you get it ""hot"" like we did, nice and zingy. The milkshake (we split a strawberry and chocolate combo) was nothing special, but it did the trick, throwing something cold and sweet into the mix. The star of the show here though is the burger, a greasy, sleazy double-patty beast griddled up smash style and oozing sauces and melted cheese. When your cheery counter person asks about toppings, just say ""all in."" Our city can be a hard place, but sitting back here with a bestie and scarfing a full tray of sloppy, meaty, carby delights—this is pure pleasure. This whole tray cost $32. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) If it seems unusual that someone would open a straight-up burger joint in the heart of Chinatown, without any sort of tourist-bait on the menu—the only Asian-influenced item is a green tea milkshake—well, that's exactly why Mary Chung and her fellow Burger By Day co-owners did it. All of them grew up here in the neighborhood, and many of them are family. ""We decided that we wanted to give something back to the community, some diversity, and we didn't want to compete with any of the excellent Asian cuisines and fusion restaurants that are already here,"" Chung told Hell Gate. ""We wanted to have something a little bit hip for the youngsters and""—she gestured at your $20 Dinner correspondent—""something different for the older people, right?"" Hell Gate total for two, including tax and milkshake, not including tip: $32.67 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Burger By Day is located at 242 Grand Street, between Bowery and Chrystie, and is currently open Sunday through Thursday from 11:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., and on Friday and Saturday from 11:00 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. (646-964-5871) Already a user?

$20 Dinner: Sky-High Thai Sliders and Buckets of Joy at Baby’s Buns and Buckets,https://hellgatenyc.com/20-dinner-babys-buns-buckets,445 Albee Square W,Baby’s Buns and Buckets (https://www.dekalbmarkethall.com/),"445+Albee+Square+W,+NYC",Baby’s Buns and Buckets,40.6907244,-73.9832855,https://www.dekalbmarkethall.com/,,,,"It says ""buckets"" right there in the name of the place, and it's one of only two categories on the menu, but still, it's kind of hilarious when your order arrives at this newish Dekalb Market stall and it's literally a whole ass bucket of food. Not a ""bowl."" A bucket. We can only hope this becomes a trend. Baby's Buns and Buckets opened a couple of months ago in the labyrinthian, neon-lit food hall in the basement of Downtown Brooklyn's City Point complex , which also houses a Target, Traders Joe's, Lulumon, and an Alamo Drafthouse, with luxury rental apartments soaring some 30 stories above. Plenty of vendors have come and gone since the Dekalb Market Hall first opened in 2017—and remember, the whole thing began as a ragtag collection of farmers, bakers, and artists in shipping containers in an empty lot before construction began—but even with all the changes and retail-gentrification here, there's still a lot of good energy to the space. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Baby's Buns & Buckets is very much a family business, run by sisters Sage and Senna Lau, whose parents own four other Thai spots around town including Thank You Come Again right across the aisle at Dekalb. Their other sister Ginger is also involved, and cousin Paul, just in from Thailand, is helping out on the register. ""Our mother [Roongkant Preechathammarach, whom everyone calls Miss Toon] is the chef of the family and the magic behind all the food,"" Sage told Hell Gate. ""But with Baby's we wanted to imagine what it would be like if we were more fast casual. We wanted to make it almost like fast food. Easy to consume, easy to understand."" As such, the Baby's Buns and Buckets menu is basically just four things prepared two different ways. There's some excellent fried chicken thigh, all crackling on the outside and juicy within, and slabs of equally good, equally crisp fried fish. The grilled honey pork is lovely, a tangle of sweet fat and chewy meat. Chunks of fried portobello round out the foursome, if you're looking for something vegetarian. You can get any of the above stacked high in an almost comically-tiny brioche bun, topped with stuff like greens, pickled onions, tomatoes, garlic mayo, papaya slaw, and chili sauce. It all falls apart pretty quickly—you'll need a fork—but it definitely does make an impression when it hits the table. As Senna told me, ""We like to be dramatic."" ""Baby's Bucket,"" starring grilled honey pork, $16 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The buckets are less messy than just eating out of the bun, but because of their size, create almost as much of a spectacle. It'd be one thing if it were a bucket of popcorn, or even pieces of fried chicken to share with your whole family—but this is a single (albeit very shareable) entree, with a pile of meat, the toppings from the buns, and around three fingers of classic sticky rice or chicken-stock soaked fatty rice. Get excited my dudes! You're eating dinner out of a bucket!! The eye-catching stall was designed and built (with help from a contractor friend) by Senna, and the really baller move is to snag the Baby's Buns mini-booth around the corner from the ordering counter. Barring that, there are a few stools set before the counters, one of which doubles as a swag shop. If all those options are taken, the market has tons of communal tables all over the place. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Hell Gate total for two, including tax but not including tip: $32.66 . Baby's Buns and Buckets is located at 445 Albee Square West, in the basement, at the Dekalb Market Hall. I always get lost down here but just walk around, you'll see it. BBB is open on weekdays from 11:15 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and on weekends from 11:15 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. (347-915-7717) Already a user? Log in Thanks for reading!

$20 Dinner: Everytable Seeks to ‘Transform the Food System’ With Microwaves and Sliding-Scale Prices,https://hellgatenyc.com/20-dinner-everytable,945 Flatbush Avenue,Everytable (https://www.everytable.com/Stores?zipCode=11201),"945+Flatbush+Ave,+NYC",Everytable,40.7580556485087,-73.8605095645337,https://www.everytable.com/,,,,"Walk into an Everytable restaurant—the new one in Flatbush, say, or the only slightly less new one on Avenue B—and you encounter a lot of inarguably correct buzz-phrases, most of which are some sort of riff on the LA-based chain's mission statement. Which, as Richard Jones, the general manager of Everytable Flatbush put it to Hell Gate, goes something like this: ""We want to transform the food system and make nutritious meals affordable and accessible to everyone in our community."" Right on, obviously! Food equality for all! East Village Everytable on Avenue B (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Obstacles abound to actually pulling this off. There's the challenge of keeping the quality of ingredients high, the prices low, and the storefronts not depressing. Then there's resistance from people who don't like feeling scolded for eating at McDonald's or whatever. And, of course, the food has to taste good and not like eating it is some sort of altruistic chore. Carnitas bowl, $6.25 in the East Village (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) All of that is hard to do! There's been a mini-boom of vegan fast food spots around town over the past few years, all with a similar goal to make healthy food more approachable. These include Lekka Burger by Amanda ""Dirt Candy"" Cohen in tony Tribeca, the activist-minded Grillled! in less-tony Bushwick, and the crazy popular, definitely not cheap Slutty Vegan in Fort Greene. But none of these hit all the marks that Everytable is going for. Chicken shawarma with yogurt sauce, $7.15 in the East Village (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Everytable was founded by Sam Polk, a former hedge-fund dude with a well-publicized asshole moment a dozen years ago when he very publicly quit Wall Street in a rage after getting ""only"" $3.6 million for his bonus. Polk later wrote a long essay in the Times about the incident, and his subsequent recovery from what he calls a ""wealth addiction,"" and today he expends most of his considerable confidence and energy these days on building Everytable into a successful chain that, as it happens, also has the potential to be a force for good. There are now six locations in New York City, in Brooklyn and Manhattan, as well as nearly 50 in Southern California. All of the NYC spots are stocked with pre-packaged, fully-cooked dishes from one central commissary kitchen, in the old Pfizer factory in Bed-Stuy. This creates both economies of scale on the production end of things and allows for more affordably-sized and staffed spaces at the retail level. The menu at the Flatbush Everytable (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Quayshawn Peete, general manager, helps a customer at the East Village Everytable (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There's no kitchen on site. You'll find just a wall of refrigerated cases for food and drinks, and an ordering counter where a couple of microwaves stand at the ready for dine-in guests. Granted, the vibe is more corporate break room than cozy cafe, but there are plenty of tables, a few plants, some art, and lots of light. Prices at each Everytable are set on a sliding scale, based on the median income of the neighborhood. The same carnitas bowl, for example, will cost you $8.95 in Chelsea, but only $6.25 in Flatbush. Portions are substantial, though you'll probably want like 1.5 dishes for a truly satisfying dinner (think of it like an appetizer or salad and an entree). Most important, almost everything I ate (six dishes in all at two different Everytables), was good. It kind of reminded me of the stuff we used to get excited about at the then-vaunted Time-Life cafeteria back in the late 1980s. The food is institutional, but not half-assed. The flavors are fresh and true, there's textural variety, lots of sauce, and it stands up well to a quick microwave nuke-ing. The fish in the ""homegirl salmon adobo"" bowl was remarkably not overcooked. The pork in the carnitas bowl had plenty of juice. The chicken in both the shawarma and the elote Caesar salad was well seasoned and also not dry. The tomato sauce on the cheese ravioli was bright and alive. The beans, the corn kernels, the greens—all still perky. The only miss, and a pretty big one, was the wan and soggy breakfast burrito. Elote Caesar salad, $7.15 in the East Village (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The menu is lengthy however, so follow your cravings (the $5 bacon cheeseburger macaroni looked like decent stoner food). There's coffee, bags of chips, fresh cut fruit, cans of kombucha, and premixed smoothies. Also—vegan brownies from Greyston bakery in Yonkers , an outfit that ""creates meaningful job opportunities for those who have experienced barriers to employment,"" including the formerly incarcerated. You can also treat a stranger to a meal through the Pay-It-Forward option at checkout. Four cheese ravioli, $5 in Flatbush (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Breakfast burrito, $5 in Flatbush (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Both of the general managers I spoke with came from outside the hospitality industry. Richard Jones in Flatbush worked at a laundromat before joining Everytable five months ago. Quayshawn Peete was at Foot Locker prior to running the East Village shop. And both men will soon enough be eligible for Everytable's unique ""university program,"" whereby employees, after only eleven months with the company, are given their own franchises to run with no money down. They have to repay the start-up money, but only after the store starts making a profit. Seating at the Flatbush Everytable (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Everytable has locations in Flatbush, Chelsea, the Financial District, Harlem, and the East Village. A Downtown Brooklyn branch is opening soon, and more stores are in the works for 2023. Hours, addresses, and menus can all be found here .

$20 Dinner: Gorgeous Fiery Stews at Flushing’s Fish With You,https://hellgatenyc.com/20-dinner-gorgeous-fiery-stews-at-flushings-fish-with-you,136-76 Roosevelt Avenue,Flushing’s Fiery Spicy Pot (https://hellgatenyc.com/fiery-spicy-pot),"136-76+Roosevelt+Avenue,+NYC",Flushing’s Fiery Spicy Pot,40.7600349999926,-73.8273356576817,https://hellgatenyc.com/fiery-spicy-pot,,,,"If you want food with some serious presence, Fish With You is your spot. This table-service Sichuan restaurant is a mega chain in China, with more than 1,000 locations. But the only one anywhere else in the world is here in Flushing, Queens. Fish With You opened over the summer near the 7 train and specializes in choose-your-own-adventure fish stews. Or maybe they're soups? Whatever, they're super hearty and alive with things like tongue-tingling green peppercorns, tangy pickled mustard greens, fiery chilis, crunchy add-ins like black fungus and beef curd, and one of two types of swimmers, basa and snakehead, both of which can hang in there with everything else going on. Inside Fish With You (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Here's how it works. First you pick your fish. The basa is plump and firm, the snakehead a little more chewy, with skin still on so there's a bit more flavor. Both are good. The latter costs three dollars more. You can also get boiled beef, though this isn't freakin' Cow With You you're eating at. Next up in your decision tree is the ""tastes,"" which basically means the broth and its attendant flavor-givers. The Pickled Mustard Fish With Green Peppercorns, which we had with snakehead, was an absolute rager, as was the Pickled Mustard Fish In Golden Soup, which had one less chili pepper in its spiciness warning but still gets your forehead sweating nonetheless. Pickled mustard basa fish in golden soup with rice noodle and leaf lettuce, $14.95 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Should we have ordered one of the tomato-based broths instead of two pickled mustard ones? Maybe. But no regrets. Those tangy chunks brought so much punch to the party I think we would have had less fun without them. Each stew is offered in two sizes, for one person (big!) or two (enormous!), and comes with your choice of two or four sides, respectively, though they aren't really ""sides"" because they're added to your dish before it hits the table. Portions of these are ample, and all four we tried—the funky fungus, the nubby bean curd, the slippery rice noodle rectangles, and the bright leaf lettuce—were worthy inclusions. Rice station (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) You get unlimited white rice with every order too, spooned out from the tiered shelves of steamers sitting over there like bleacher creatures, watching the action, waiting for the call to come in. It's a lot of food! Plus there are snacks at Fish With You, like the porky panko skewers we wolfed down with glee. Spicy chicken chunks, Taiwan sausage, pumpkin pie (?), and golden steam buns are also available in this category. Spicy pork skewers, $6.95 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Fish With You is sleekly designed, with seating for nearly 50 people and an ordering counter in the back if you're getting takeout. Each table has its own little drawer of utensils and napkin reups, which is very cute. The soundtrack is all contemporary Chinese pop songs. The stock photos are goofy as hell. The vibe, it is good. Hell Gate total for two, including tax, but not including tip and some delicious ice cold passion fruit tea: $40.78 Fish With You is located at 135-25A 40th Road, between Main and Prince Streets, and is currently open from 11:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. daily (718-799-0818) Already a user?

$20 Dinner: Sacred Sandwich Space Eisenberg’s Reborn as S&P,https://hellgatenyc.com/20-dinner-court-street-grocers-guys-save-sacred-sandwich-space-eisenbergs,174 Fifth Avenue,S&P (https://eisenbergsnyc.com),"174+Fifth+Avenue,+NYC",S&P,40.7411077,-73.9901838,https://eisenbergsnyc.com,,,,"First off, before we start lolling around in sandwich heaven, it's important to note that S&P, which the Court Street Grocers guys Matt Ross and Eric Finkelstein opened a few weeks ago in the long-time Eisenberg's space across from the Flatiron, is absolutely NOT some kind of evil hipster beardo Brooklyn takeover or whatever. Yes, the beloved lunch counter has been around for nearly a century, but there's been like seven different owners during that time, the last of whom, hotel heir Warren Chiu, trademarked the name Eisenberg's, closed it down in 2021 after just three years of service (and a failed attempt at turning it into a chain), and skipped town. And when the place first opened back in 1928? The name on the sign outside said S&P. Full circle, baby! The legendary tuna melt is as perfect as ever, $12 (Scott Lynch/ Hell Gate) Still though, Ross and Finkelstein know how precious few spots there are like Eisenberg's left in this or any other part of town—inexpensive restaurants where you can wolf a good, quick meal at the counter or linger with a buddy at a table in the back. So despite a few welcome upgrades (the comfy banquette), there are even more details about the new S&P (the still-battered stools at the counter, the old-school sassy servers in the dining room), that ensure it feels like the last time you ate here, three, seven, or twenty years ago. Most important, there's the S&P menu which, even in its current ""limited"" state, is packed with a glorious array of all-time diner greats. There's a turkey club, a reuben, a BLT with mayo on white, an egg salad sandwich, a cream cheese and olive sandwich, corned beef hash, a stack of pancakes, latkes, chopped liver, a bowl of mushroom barley soup, salami and eggs... in its final form, there'll be nearly 100 different dishes from which to choose. The back room has a new banquette. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The back room has a new banquette. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) I stuffed myself silly here late one afternoon last week (technically a “$20 lunch,” I guess, but I definitely didn't need dinner that night) starting with my forever Eisenberg go-to, the tuna melt. It was as perfect as ever, just a thick, rich, creamy masterpiece of four ingredients: canned tuna, mayo, American cheese, griddled rye. Fat pickle on the side makes five. Dip it in ketchup or mustard for six. Another pro sandwich order at S&P is the peanut butter (which gets all melty) and bacon (crisp and abundant), also served on rye. This is not a gimmick! Get it with some soup or, heck, with a chocolate egg cream or vanilla milkshake, and you have a meal suited for the gods. The regular cheeseburger costs eight bucks. It's nothing fancy, but it is delicious, an impressively juicy patty covered in American cheese, pickle chips, a squirt of mustard, and raw white onion for some bite. Big spenders can throw down four dollars more for the dinkelburger , which arrives gooey with muenster and a slab of pastrami. Cherry lime rickey, $5. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Cherry lime rickey, $5. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Either way you'll want a side dish, like the circular cottage fries, or the macaroni salad, or the baked beans, or, the correct choice, S&P's potato knish, which is fried to a marvelous crackle and still fluffy inside. When I ordered this I asked for a crock of mustard and my server Ann was like, ""yeah honey we know, that's how it comes."" So basically, Ross and Finkelstein nailed it. S&P is a pleasant, energizing, extremely satisfying place to sit and eat, with so many appealing items on the menu that there's no way we're getting bored here any time soon. A woman who works next door to the restaurant, who preferred not to give her name, told us she'd eaten at Eisenberg's for 47 years, and has already been to S&P three times in its opening weeks. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""It feels really great,"" Ross told Hell Gate about revitalizing the space. ""It's been truly rewarding. It's been a rough couple of weeks [dealing with the big crowds] but I think we've generally made most people happy. We just want to keep the place true to itself, be true to ourselves, be true to what people want, and that's the best we can do. It doesn't need to be a destination. It's not a theme park. This is a place that people can eat at."" Hell Gate total for two, including tax and a tart-n-sweet cherry lime rickey, but not including tip: $39.20 S&P is located at 174 Fifth Avenue, between 22nd and 23rd Streets, and is currently open on weekdays from 8:00 to 5:00 p.m., and on weekends from 10:00 to 5:00. Ross said that early dinner hours, probably until 8:00 p.m., will be coming at some point. (212-691-TUNA) Already a user? Log in Thanks for reading!

"Feel Right at Home at The York, a New East Village Bar Slinging Some Stellar Smashburgers",https://hellgatenyc.com/the-york-burgers,186 Avenue B,The York (https://www.instagram.com/theyorknyc/),"186+Avenue+B,+NYC",The York,40.7278642,-73.9794103,https://www.instagram.com/theyorknyc/,,,,"If you've gone out drinking in the East Village at any point over the past five years, and particularly if you stop in at some of the neighborhood's more classic haunts, it's extremely possible that James Hurst did the pouring. Hurst arrived here in 2017 from Los Angeles, immediately started tending bar at 7A, then got behind the sticks at places like Black and White (RIP) and Niagara, until he and his buddy Hayden Tobin (and his now-wife Kayla Rebentisch) started thinking, why don't we just open our own place? That place is the just-opened bar The York on Avenue B, and it's terrific. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""We looked around in Brooklyn,"" Hurst told Hell Gate. ""I wanted the East Village but before COVID it was too expensive here, plus the limitations, the liquor authority... it was a lot harder to do back then. Then COVID happened, prices dropped, and this place on Avenue B popped up on the map—it was a clothing store, and a T-Mobile at one point—so we just went for it."" Hurst and Tobin signed a lease in early 2021, then spent two years building out everything from scratch. Finally, just last Friday, they opened The York, a homey little bar with decent prices, a lived-in feel (Rebentisch did the design and decor), and, thanks to Tobin and chef consultant Anthony Nassif, a menu of world-class smashburgers and chicken sandwiches that totally hit the spot (even if you're not sucking down $5 pints at 9pm on a Wednesday night). All three burgers are awesome. The ""double York"" delivers textbook smashburger goodness, all greasy and gloppy from melted American, caramelized onions, and special sauce. The ""rodeo burger"" adds a mess of crisp fried onions, bacon bits, and a zingy house-made barbecue sauce to the mix. And the ""Opie's"" is billed as an ""Oklahoma-style"" burger and involves a ton of griddled onions. Breakfast sandwich with hash brown, $7 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There are three versions of The York's chicken sandwich too, starting with a simple ""with pickles"" foundational one and then adding stuff until you get to the excellent spicy rendition. And the all-night breakfast sandwich is great too: an over-easy fried egg snuggled under a gooey cheese blanket, studded with bacon, all on an English muffin and accompanied by a crock of ketchup and a lovely oval hash brown. The skinny, salty french fries and fat, crispy onion rings are both equally good to pair with any and all of the above, so get both if you're sharing your meal with someone special or, heck, even if you're lone-wolfing stuff. Nassif told Hell Gate that they're working on a brunch menu, and it too will have he calls a ""nostalgic, fast food vibe, but with good ingredients."" (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Like the drinks prices here, all the food is—dare I say it—blessedly reasonable. ""I think a lot of places around here are priced for the Friday and Saturday night crowd,"" said Hurst. ""You don't have to charge so much, and you can still make enough money. You don't have to be too greedy. I think people appreciate that."" Spicy chicken sandwich, $12 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Besides, Hurst and Tobin are hoping to make The York an easy local hang rather than a drunken destination. ""We really want to do something for the people who actually live in the neighborhood. A place where you go on a Tuesday night. An extension of your apartment, where you can hang out and meet your friends. That's really what we want to cultivate."" The York is located at 186 Avenue B, between 11th and 12th Streets, and is currently open for drinks from 2:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. daily, and for food until about 10:00 p.m. on Sunday through Thursday, and until 12:00 midnight on Friday and Saturday.

Crave-worthy Katsu at Mama Yoshi Mini Mart in Ridgewood,https://hellgatenyc.com/chicken-katsu-at-yoshi-mini-mart-ridgewood,1711 Grove Street,Mama Yoshi Mini Mart (https://example.com/mama-yoshi-mini-mart),"1711+Grove+Street,+NYC",Mama Yoshi Mini Mart,40.7032244,-73.9111673,https://example.com/mama-yoshi-mini-mart,,,,"Yukiko Muneyasu and Miles Tickler, who both grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area before moving to Ridgewood together in 2016, aren't looking to create some sort of convenience store empire with their amazing and delightful Mama Yoshi Mini Mart. They really just want to make you an awesome chicken sandwich. As Muneyasu put it to Hell Gate last week, ""I started making fried chicken in New York because in the Bay Area, there were so many bars that I loved to go to just to eat their chicken sandwich, and I wanted to create that for somebody here. I wanted to be somebody's favorite chicken sandwich."" But after running pop-ups in various Brooklyn bars for five years or so, including a lengthy residency at All Night Skate, the couple grew weary of the night life. ""We decided we'd like to open up something more...daytime,"" Muneyasu told Hell Gate. ""We realized the bar life was not working for us. We needed sunlight."" Miles Tickler with another satisfied Mama Yoshi customer. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) So in February 2021, they signed the lease on a corner spot in their own neighborhood, on Grove and Cypress where a dry cleaners used to be; spent months building the place out; and last December, opened Mama Yoshi, a Japanese-style convenience store with of an array of snacks, grab-and-go items, and made-to-order meals. And it totally rules. Start with the chicken katsu sandwich, a sprawling slab of heavily seasoned fried bird topped with more than enough pickles and several squirts of an orange mayo-y sauce, all completely uncontained by its potato bun. (The spicy version, which is what I ordered, is made with a secret blend of some 13 different spices.) It's so good. There's a vegan version, too, made with cauliflower. And it comes with a pile of thick-cut Utz Ripples, so you don't really need to get a side of Muneyasu's excellent macaroni salad, or potato salad, or, heck, her hijiki salad, but I do it anyway. Macaroni salad, $3.50. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The other Mama Yoshi star is Muneyasu's Spam grilled cheese, with its funky meat and gobs of oozing American cheese squeezed between slices of milk bread. If you're seeking something that's less obviously in the stoner/hangover food family, there are rice bowls here as well, topped with the likes of flaked salmon and microgreens. Spam grilled cheese, $12. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) You might also find three types of onigiri on hand, including a crisp shrimp tempura, with a tail jutting playfully from the top, and a vegan ume, packed with pickled plum. Other grab-and-go choices are in the hot case: a weighty beef don, a coffee cup overflowing with fried chicken. And the selection of snacks, sweets, and sauces is substantial. Tickler promised they'd be stocking a bunch of ""deep cuts"" from Japan in those departments soon. Spicy salmon rice bowl, $18. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) It's a tight menu for sure, but with just enough variety to get you eating here once a week. Seating is limited to some stools at a counter along the front window, and a few tables in the fenced-in sidewalk ""terrace."" There's a friendly, home-cooked vibe to it all, which makes sense given Muneyasu's lack of formal back-of-house restaurant experience. ""I learned to cook from my mom,"" she said. ""I took her recipes and kind of changed them up a bit."" Mama Yoshi Mini Mart is located at 1711 Grove Street, at the corner of Cypress Avenue, and is currently open Wednesday through Saturday from 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Already a user?

Zhego Serves a Fantastic Bhutanese Feast in Woodside,https://hellgatenyc.com/zhego-fantastic-bhutanese-feast-woodside-queens,38-4 61st Street,Zhego (https://example.com/zhego),"38-4+61st+Street,+NYC",Zhego,40.7475652,-73.9026985,https://example.com/zhego,,,,"There's a lot of good fortune involved in the origin story of Zhego, a passionately authentic Bhutanese restaurant that opened at the beginning of the year in Woodside, Queens. Co-owners Tobden Jamphel, the chef, and Sonan Tshering Singye, who runs the front of the house, were great friends growing up in Bhutan, a bicycle-loving Himalayan country in South Asia bordered on either side by China and India. But after high school, the pair lost touch, as people do—until they bumped into each other a few years ago at a basketball tournament in Queens. Neither one had known that the other had moved to New York City. ""It was totally out of the blue,"" Singye told Hell Gate of their reunion. At the time, Jamphel, who learned to cook by feeding his younger sisters and brother (""My job was to cook for them because my parents were always away,"" he said), was selling meals to Woodside locals out of his apartment, through a business called Laya; Singye joined the operation. The crucial third piece fell into place when they randomly met Tenzin Norb, who happened to be sitting on a five-year lease for a storefront on 61st Street, about two blocks from the 7 train, and didn't know what to do with the space. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The answer, fortunately for the rest of us because it's awesome, turned out to be Zhego, a rare NYC restaurant focusing exclusively on Bhutanese food. The three ""brothers from other mothers,"" as Singye refers to the trio, opened the restaurant in January. ""I think this is the second Bhutanese restaurant currently operating,"" said Singye. ""But we officially proclaim that this the first authentic Bhutanese restaurant, because of the red rice, the dried red chile, the dried white chile, and the Sichuan pepper, all of which we import directly from Bhutan."" Baggies of dried white chilis are shipped over from a friend in Bhutan. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) That's a contention we're in no position to challenge, but I can say that Zhego has a bunch of really amazing dishes that I've never eaten before. There's the ema datsi, for example, ""the national dish of Bhutan"" that's literally just a pile of fiery green chilis with a mixture of American and feta cheeses melted all over it. It is so, so good, either wolfed down straight or dumped over the big mound of chewy red rice that comes with your meal. Ema datsi, green chilis and cheese, the national dish of Bhutan, $10.49. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Another cheesy delight is the shakam shukam datsi, a thick stew packed with funky chunks of air-dried beef (not quite jerky texture, but close) and kicky dried white chilis. There's also a version of this dish with air-dried pork. Red chilis, also dried and quite spicy, make a welcome appearance in Jamphel's excellent goep paa, paired with generous hunks of tender beef tripe and numbing Sichuan peppercorn. Half the menu at Zhego is vegetarian, including some cheese and cabbage momo (which we're definitely getting next time), Bhutanese fried rice, and both of its noodle dishes. In the latter category, we loved the jangbuli, a deeply satisfying mess of hand-pulled beauties stir-fried in ginger and that Sichuan pepper. Jangbuli, hand-pulled noodles stir-fried in ginger and Sichuan pepper, $12.49. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) For more meaty options, there are pork ribs, a stir-fried pork belly dish called phaksha bayzum, and a chicken stew known as jashu maru. Whatever you get, though, also get a cup of warm butter tea, which is somehow refreshing despite being salty as hell. There's only room for about a dozen people here, on benches that double as storage space, beneath the Instagrammable (complete with hashtag) neon sign. And Woodside's Bhutanese community has definitely discovered the place, so don't be surprised if you have to wait for a table during prime dinner hours. ""Most of the customers feel like, 'Wow, I miss my mom,' when they eat here,"" said Singye. ""We're overwhelmed with happiness by that response."" Zhego is located at 38-4 61st Street, between 38th and 39th Avenues, and is open every day except Tuesday from about 12:00 noon to about 10:00 or 10:30 p.m. Note that the restaurant is closed this week until Thursday, February 24, for Losar, the Tibetan New Year.

Balkan Street Food? Balkan Streat Food!,https://hellgatenyc.com/balkan-street-food-balkan-streat,353 Sixth Avenue,Balkan Streat (https://www.instagram.com/balkan_streat/),"353+Sixth+Avenue,+NYC",Balkan Streat,40.7321508,-74.0009771,https://www.instagram.com/balkan_streat/,,,,"William Djuric, the chef and co-owner (along with his buddy Jason Correa), of the new Balkan Streat on the West Village stretch of Sixth Avenue, was born and raised here in New York City. He still lives here, too, with his wife on the Upper East Side. But despite being a NYC kid through and through, a part of his heart (and his stomach) is always in the Balkans. ""I grew up with this food,"" Djuric told Hell Gate as he filled our table with trays of cevapi and pljeskavica, burek and krofne. ""My dad was from Nis, Serbia, and we used to go over every summer, except for a few years in the '90s when it was really bad there. Plus my wife is also Serbian on her dad's side, and her mother's Croatian. I literally dream of this food, the way it's done over there."" So even though Djuric spent his cooking career in places like Gramercy Tavern and Momofuku Ssam (Correa is the operations guy), when it came time to open his first restaurant, slinging Balkan street food was obviously the way to go. ""Especially coming out of the pandemic, people crave comfort food,"" said Djuric. ""And this is my ultimate comfort food, so I'm just trying to share it with New York City the way I remember it, inspired by late nights in Belgrade and early mornings curing that hangover."" (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Balkan Streat is a counter-service spot with about 20 seats, a pockmarked concrete wall with a faded-looking mural, a kind of weird light sculpture thing on the ceiling, a well-curated hip hop soundtrack, and, whether you're hungover or not, a bunch of really good things to eat that you rarely come across anywhere else around here. The place to start is the burek, thick triangular slices of flaky, oily, hand-stretched filo dough stuffed with things like ground lamb and beef, or spinach and ""white cow's cheese,"" or roasted peppers and kashkaval cheese, or mashed potatoes and onion. Ground lamb and beef burek, $7.50, with yogurt, $1.50 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) These are so good, and so filling, it makes you wonder why burek isn't more of a thing in our city. And definitely get your slab with a side of yogurt for dipping (or sipping). It brings a delightful tang to the party. The cevapi, which Djuric describes as Balkan kebabs and are about the size of a plump breakfast sausage, are also terrific and fun to eat, arriving in sets of five on a tray laden with accoutrements:—chunks of charred lepinja bread, pickled yellow peppers, raw white onions, shredded cabbage, thick kajmak cheese, a zippy orange avjar sauce. Cevapi platter, $12 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Another alcohol-sopping meaty delight is the pljeskavica, a Balkan burger which you can get ""regular"" or stuffed with smoked ham and melted cheese, punjena-style. There are sides like spicy mashed potatoes, paprika-laden baked beans made from Djuric's father's recipe, and a bright shopska salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, and cheese. Pljeskavica, the ""Balkan burger,"" $12 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) All of the bread and pastry used in these dishes are made on site by Milan Milijancevic, a baker Djuric found in Belgrade and flew over here on a specialty visa ""because he's so talented at what he does."" Milijancevic makes krofne, too, which are bready donuts with, on the day we went, a bit of strawberry, or pistachio, or nutella inside. Milan Milijancevic, Balkan Streat's baker from Belgrade (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Strawberry, pistachio, and Nutella krofne, $6 each (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) So far, said Djuric, the NYC Balkan community has been showing their support. ""One of the coolest things is seeing all the different Balkan people come together. Sounds a little corny but we have people from every part of the region who historically might not get along, but everyone is enjoying the food and sitting together and I think that's a cool thing."" And apparently Balkan Streat is something of an international sensation as well. ""It's all over the news in the Balkans, on TV, and all these newspapers are reaching out to us,"" said Djuric. ""They're excited that New Yorkers are experiencing the food, that we're spreading the word. I don't think people are as familiar with Balkan food as they should be."" (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Balkan Streat is located at 353 Sixth Avenue, between West Washington Place and West 4th Street, and is currently open on Tuesday through Thursday, and Sunday, from 11:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., and Friday and Saturday from 11:00 to 10:00 Already a user?

Gloriously Gooey Slices and Great Vibes at Velma in Ridgewood,https://hellgatenyc.com/gloriously-gooey-slices-and-great-vibes-at-velma-in-ridgewood,584 Seneca Avenue,Velma (https://example.com/velma),"584+Seneca+Avenue,+NYC",Velma,40.7042332,-73.9104028,https://example.com/velma,,,,"Velma is a brand new neighborhood restaurant and bar with a classic red-sauce menu—pizzas, pastas, parms—on a bustling stretch of Seneca Avenue in Ridgewood, Queens. It's the second restaurant in the area from Paulina Grigonis and J.R. Savage, who also run the four-year-old Gordo's Cantina right over the borough border in Bushwick. Their first place reflects Grigonis's heritage (she's from León, in Guanajuato, Mexico); the new spot is a homage to Savage's family, ""straight-up Italian-Americans from Queens,"" as Grigonis put it to Hell Gate. The couple have lived in Ridgewood for about seven years, and Velma has been open for three weeks. But if you didn't know any of that, and popped into Velma cold, you'd think the joint had been here for years. Decades even. The big front room has tin walls chipped all to hell, a tin ceiling, exposed raw brick and battered old wood beams. There's a twisty, wiggly-worm-shaped bar, which encourages group hangs, and, for now anyway (it might get removed to add more seating), a full-sized pool table by the front door. Fingers crossed this beauty stays. I can't remember the last time I saw one of these at a new place. Holy shit! A pool table! (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There's a more intimate dining room in the back, with red-and-white checked tablecloths and framed family photos of the staff hanging on wood-paneled walls. Throughout the space an abundance of random decor—taxidermy, weird ""statement"" table lamps, a stack of old luggage—add to the lived-in vibe. The back dining room features family photos of Velma staffers (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) And it's not like Grigonis and Savage planned to open such a retro-feeling restaurant. When they signed the lease near the end of 2021, the space had been a 99-cent store for years and the couple only discovered the vintage infrastructure when they tore down the drop ceiling and knocked down the walls. ""We were like, we hit the jackpot,"" said Grigonis. Plus they've had a ton of downtime here this past year, waiting for months to get the FDNY to approve their range hood kitchen. ""It was a nightmare,"" said Grigonis. ""We submitted the plans last May, and only just heard back. We've had our liquor license since August, the kitchen staff has been ready to go, but we couldn't open. Everyone says, 'Oh it looks so beautiful you did such a good job.' Well, we had a long time to work on it, moving things around, adding stuff, and trying different pizzas."" Grandma pie, $26 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Those pizzas are at the heart of the Velma menu. You can get slices, either cheese or pepperoni, which are made in classic NYC-fold style and are really good if you love a ton of cheese. Seriously, these are among the cheesiest slices in town, rivaling Sal and Carmine's for sheer gooeyness. Grandma pie side view (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The grandma pie is outstanding, not nearly as thick and bready as you'd might expect, redolent with garlic, charred without fear. It's huge, too, easily enough for two or even three people for $26. The round pies also feed at least two, and come in varieties like vodka pepperoni, potato and rosemary, and a meaty ""manolo special"" with ricotta. ""The Jimmy,"" with chicken cutlet, prosciutto, and mozzarella, $18 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Roast pork sandwich, $18 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There are also a half dozen splittable sandwiches on the menu, made on loaves of crusty semolina bread. These aren't over-stuffed, they're just long and large. The roast pork with broccoli, roasted garlic, and provolone hit the spot, as did ""the Jimmy,"" with its fried chicken cutlet, prosciutto for some funk, and thick slices of mozzarella. For something snackier, get the little bag of chicken nuggets. Cute little bag of chicken nuggets, $6 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) So that's the bar menu, which may or may not merge with the full dining room menu debuting next week. A sneak peek at the latter shows several pastas, a highly Instagrammable "" caprese stack ,"" and entrees like chicken parmigiana and a grilled pork chop. But however the menu logistics and pool table situation shakes out, Grigonis and Savage are just psyched to be open, feeding their friends and neighbors in a fun place to hang out. ""We've gotten a good response from the neighborhood so far,"" said Grigonis. ""I mean, they've seen the sign outside for the longest time, so everyone's like, 'finally .'"" (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Velma is located at 584 Seneca Avenue, between Menahan and Grove Streets, and is currently open on Tuesday through Thursday from 12:00 noon to 9:00 p.m., and on Friday and Saturday from 12:00 to 10:00.

It’s a Family Affair at Lin & Daughters in the West Village,https://hellgatenyc.com/lin-and-daughters-west-village,181 West 4th Street,Lin & Daughters (https://example.com/lin-daughters),"181+West+4th+Street,+NYC",Lin & Daughters,40.7325286,-74.0016758,https://example.com/lin-daughters,,,,"For Becky Lin, a first-time restaurateur who just opened a charming little counter service spot on West 4th Street, dumplings mean love. Lin grew up in Fuzhou, China, before her family moved to New York when she was almost 12. ""When I was working in our family restaurant [on Long Island] as a teenager, we would all make dumplings together after closing, the whole family sitting around the table. It was a very bonding experience,"" she told Hell Gate. ""It made me feel happy. So dumplings have always brought me joy."" (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) But maybe, even with that memory, noodles were even more beloved? ""My original handle on my Instagram was @NoodleOverDumplings,"" Lin said with a chuckle. Either way, everything on the appealing, noodle- and dumpling-dominated menu here at Lin & Daughters has a personal history behind it, whether it's something Lin created—""just a combination of me experimenting""—or a dish passed down from her parents and grandparents. There's the platter of pork and chive dumplings, for example, that are sometimes made by Baba Lin himself when he comes in to help out his daughter in the kitchen. These wrinkly, thin-skinned Fujianese beauties work especially well if you break tradition and dump on some sriracha. Pan fried cumin beef dumplings, $12.99. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Baba is also responsible for the beef filling in the pan-fried dumplings, though Lin is the one who decided to add all that cumin, giving them some extra zing. The dumplings stuffed with a Japanese-style chicken curry are her creation as well. Lin's sibling Mike gets a menu shoutout with my favorite dish of the feast, Brother Lin's beef noodle soup. A riff on the Taiwanese national dish, Lin's version includes chili oil and jalapenos if you order it spicy (which you obviously should do), swimming around the meltingly tender brisket, crunchy bok choy, and slippery noodles. ""I wanted people to come in and feel like they were eating at an auntie's place."" (Scott Lynch/ Hell Gate) Sister Lin's chicken noodle soup is, per the menu, ""heartwarming and good for the soul, and so is my little sister Lili."" Awwww. Mom's wonton soup is also a longtime Lin family favorite. And if you're in the mood for something rich and sticky, Grandma's peanut butter noodles, a Fujianese classic, makes for a terrific accompaniment to...literally everything else here. (Including, probably, the chocolate lava bubble tea.) And yes, the namesake daughters get in on the action through Lin's four-year-old's invention, a stack of cheesy scallion pancakes, which are as gooey and glorious as they sound. Cheesy scallion pancakes, $9.99 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Lin first got involved in the professional dumpling game through a website called Shef , which she likened to ""an Etsy for food,"" offering a platform to home cooks who wanted to test the market for their stuff without making a big upfront financial commitment. According to the site, most of the ""shefs"" are women, and 80 percent are people of color. Lin's success on Shef gave her the confidence to actively pursue finding a location for her dream dumpling shop, but it had to be near her home in the West Village. ""I needed it to be close to my kids,"" she said. ""I knew it would be long hours, and I wanted to still be able to see them as much as possible."" This slightly elevated spot on West 4th Street, which used to be a ramen restaurant, and before that a sushi place, was perfect. Grandma's peanut butter noodles, $9.99. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) A Kickstarter raised more than $6,000 for, among other things, the homey design touches inside. ""I wanted people to come in and feel like they were eating at an auntie's place,"" she said. ""I made it as cozy as possible. It feels like a Chinese household, I hope, but with some Western influences, like the fireplace. It's really a mix of both. Very much like myself."" Lin & Daughters is located at 181 West 4th Street, between Jones and Barrow Streets, and is currently open on Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday, from 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., and on Friday and Saturday from 11:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. (917-645-0229) Already a user?

This Is a Good Time: Hainan Chicken House in Sunset Park,https://hellgatenyc.com/hainan-chicken-house-in-sunset-park,4807 Eighth Avenue,Hainan Chicken (),"4807+Eighth+Avenue,+NYC",Hainan Chicken,40.6418927,-74.0025413,https://hellgatenyc.com/20-dollar-dinner-urban-hawker-market,,,,"Hainanese chicken rice, in all of its variations across Southeast Asia, never looks like much when it hits the table. The meat is poached and pale, the skin unseasoned, the accompanying white rice and bowl of broth only adding to the whole 1950s hospital-plate vibe. Don't be dissuaded! When it's done well, as it is at, for example, Hainan Jones in Midtown's Urban Hawker food hall, or at Eat Gai in the Essex Market, or at Three Roosters in Hell's Kitchen, or at the brand new Hainan Chicken House in Sunset Park, the dish is a revelation, rich in flavor and comfort-food textures. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) As you would expect from the name, Hainan Chicken House puts the dish front and center, and it's a solid entry into the city's chicken rice canon, with juicy meat, chewy rice, and a broth that almost startles with its lushness. Gnaw the bird off the bone, drink deeply of the soup, stuff your face with sticky rice. This is a good time. It's also plated differently here than most versions around town. ""We serve the chicken rice in balls, which traditionally you'd find in Malaysia, and serve all our rice plates on butcher paper,"" Chris Low, one of the owners of this family-run business told Hell Gate. ""That's how we remember takeout growing up in Malaysia, everything wrapped in a sheet of plastic and newspaper. We wanted to recreate some of that feeling here. It's nostalgic for us. When we see it like that, it hits us a certain way."" Curry laksa mee, $12.95 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) You can get your chicken roasted instead of poached if you want, though that seems to defeat the purpose of the place. If you want to mix things up, though, get the roast pork belly, which is glistening with fat and crisp around on the edges with charred barbecue sauce. The Taiwanese chicken thighs with ground pork gravy and mustard greens sounds interesting as well. Roast pork belly with chicken rice, $12.50 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Hainan Chicken House also offers huge bowls of what they call popular Malaysian soup, like the lively curry laksa mee we slurped down, laden with shrimp, shredded chicken, tofu puffs, and thick egg noodles. Next time we're getting the one with crispy fried fish head and rice noodles. Three vegetable sides round out the offerings here, all of which nicely complement the chicken rice and still keep you under our twenty buck limit. There's garlicky and slightly sweet asparagus in sesame sauce, bok choy with oyster dressing, and a pile of tart pickled mustard greens. Asparagus with sesame sauce, $5 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Hainan Chicken House is a counter service restaurant, so order up front near the entrance and grab a seat at one of the utilitarian wooden tables. Someone will bring your food, but please bus after yourself when you're done. Low's father, a seasoned restaurateur, was in charge of the decor, which consists mostly of tiles depicting different breeds of chickens. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""Thai food is the king of Southeast Asian food in New York City,"" said Low. ""But I think Malaysian cuisine, and Indonesian food, are just as special, and deserve to be as popular. I think you're starting to see some broader recognition of that these days, and hopefully we can help it continue."" (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Hainan Chicken House is located at 4807 Eighth Avenue, between 48th and 49th Streets, in Brooklyn, and is currently open every day from 11:00 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. If you're coming by subway, and are less familiar Sunset's Park's Chinatown than the more storied ones in Manhattan and Flushing, the move is to take the N train to the 8th Avenue stop and walk north to the restaurant, about 13 blocks, to check out the neighborhood's incredibly vibrant scene along the way.

New Bed-Stuy Bar Boasts Beautiful Burger,https://hellgatenyc.com/new-bed-stuy-bar-boasts-beautiful-burger,1452 Fulton Street,Three Maples (https://example.com/three-maples),"1452+Fulton+Street,+NYC",Three Maples,40.6799097,-73.942727,https://example.com/three-maples,,,,"Three Maples, a spacious new bar in Bed-Stuy that serves a short, appealing menu of first-rate food, probably wouldn't exist if the pandemic hadn't upended everything three years ago. Back in pre-pandemic times, Matthew Lief, Michael Felix, and Maria Dela Cruz were plenty busy with their Landhaus operation, running a stand at Berg'n in Crown Heights, spending weekends slinging food at the Smorgasburgs, and setting up shop at festivals like Gov Ball. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Berg'n never reopened after the initial COVID lockdown and, after a stint doing meal delivery for the city, Lief, Felix, and Dela Cruz started plotting how to pull off an idea they'd been tossing around since they first met as sous chefs  at the fancy Hotel Pierre in Manhattan. ""We just wanted to do a neighborhood bar,"" Lief told Hell Gate, ""and build up a following the old-fashioned way, through the quality of our food, drinks, and atmosphere."" And so last week we got Three Maples on Fulton Street, right near the Kingston-Throop C train stop. Its vibes are very much what they envisioned—a comfortable, welcoming place to post up for a few beers and grab some simple, well-executed food that's better than you'd expect from a neighborhood bar. Smoked barbecue wings, $15 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Though all three partners are chefs by trade, Dela Cruz runs the kitchen at Three Maples, which serves a few classic Landhaus bangers as well as enough new dishes to keep regulars excited. The burger is the place to start, mostly because it's awesome. A four-ounce patty is topped in the traditional fashion (lettuce, tomato, onion, melted American) with a bunch of ""haus sauce"" glopping things up. Very solid fries, too. I lived two blocks away from Three Maples for around five years, and on so many winter nights wished there was somewhere close by I could sit and chill and eat a plate of food like this with no fuss for under twenty bucks. Too late for me, but not for thee. Fish and chips, $17 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There's a fried chicken sandwich here too, spicy with scotch bonnets, sweet with pickle slaw (also served with fries, or a salad if you're feeling dainty), and a comically long and large slab of beer-battered haddock served over a bed of chips (in this case, fries). All of these are dinner-sized portions, but there's some good shareable stuff here as well, led by the team's ""world famous"" Landaus bacon (smoked in-house, slow-roasted for maximum tenderness, and slick with maple syrup). The barbecue wings are also crazy smoky, and the eloté dip (which is exactly what it sounds like), is so much fun it could easily supplant the bacon as the joint's signature snack. The Caesar, $9 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Landhaus bacon, $10 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Eloté dip, $8 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) A couple of salads (the cheesy Caesar was decent), offer optional add-ons like lardons, grilled chicken, or shrimp skewers to make an under-twenty-dollar meal. Charred broccoli with garlic and chili flakes and that ""old-standby"" blistered shishito peppers round out the food options for now. House cocktails are $15 and under, there are wines by the glass or bottle, and a draft beer from brewers like Industrial Arts, Grimm, and Mast Landing will set you back like nine bucks. Sit at the long marble bar, or at the even longer marble counter, or at one of the baller banquettes in the front and back of the place. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""This is our first brick and mortar where we have full control over everything,"" said Lief. ""Where we're not just an amenity at someone else's bar. We're rooted here."" (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Three Maples is located at 1452 Fulton Street, between Kingston and Tompkins Avenues, and is currently open from 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight on Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday, and from 4:00 to 2:00 a.m. on Friday and Saturday.

Next Stop Vegan Brings Next-Level Plant-Based Dominican Food To Downtown Brooklyn,https://hellgatenyc.com/next-stop-vegan-brings-next-level-plant-based-dominican-food-to-downtown-brooklyn,88 Livingston Street,"Slutty Vegan (https://www.bkmag.com/2022/09/23/slutty-vegan/), Lekka Burger (https://gothamist.com/food/amanda-cohen-lekka-plant-based-burger-tribeca)","88+Livingston+Street,+NYC",Slutty Vegan,40.6912119,-73.9907069,https://www.bkmag.com/2022/09/23/slutty-vegan/,,,,"A plant-based lifestyle didn't come naturally to Blenlly Mena, the co-owner, with her boyfriend Javier Saba, of Next Stop Vegan, which just opened its second location in Downtown Brooklyn near Court Street. ""I was born and raised in the Bronx, Grand Concourse and Kingsbridge,"" Mena told Hell Gate. ""Veganism was not a thing in my upbringing."" But when her father passed away right before she graduated college, Mena said she ""started to take an interest in healthier eating"" and, in 2014, adopted a plant-based diet ""as an experiment"" and it changed her life. ""It reversed my cholesterol,"" she said. ""I lost drastic weight, and experienced an amazing transformation. Next Step Vegan arose from that whole journey."" Mena's first venture was in the Bronx, though it was more of a ""vegan meal-prep business"" than a restaurant, and has since closed. Then in the summer of 2021 she and Saba opened a counter-service version of Next Stop Vegan in Washington Heights, ""right in the middle of all these pernil places, roasting chickens in the window, and chicharrones,"" and it's been a hit. So much so that the pair have already expanded with this charming spot on Livingston Street, on the border of Brooklyn Heights and Downtown Brooklyn. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Next Stop Vegan stars an impressively lengthy menu of comfort food classics, and everything is made from plant-based ingredients. There are Chickn' Tenders with fries, for example, and a Pulled 'Pork' sandwich, a bacon cheeseburger-ish creation called the Veganator, and a Philly Cheesesteak. Restaurants built around these sorts of ""vegan gateway"" dishes for the curious have become increasingly common over the past few years, at places like the rowdy Slutty Vegan in Fort Greene, the activism-minded Grilled! in Bushwick, and Amanda ""Dirt Candy"" Cohen's Lekka Burger in Tribeca. But what distinguishes Next Stop Vegan from those spots is that most of the menu here skews toward vegan versions of Mexican or Dominican favorites. For example, there's a terrific take on the Dominican street-food sandwich called the chimi, with the usual beef or pork patty swapped out for a housemade black bean and brown rice concoction that brings plenty of life to the party. It's basically a burger, but on soft Portuguese bread, and topped with crisp cabbage, tomato, and a lively orange chimichurri sauce. (You can also get this messy beast sandwiched between fried tostones instead of bread, but we wouldn't call it ""healthy."") The Twisted Burrito, $15.99 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There's some good vegan stoner food here as well, including a ""twisted burrito"" packed with grilled portobellos, creamy mac-n-cheese, seasoned ground fake-beef, chunky pico de gallo, avocado, soy cheese, and several sauces, all accompanied, perhaps unnecessarily, by tortilla chips. It's a belly bomb for sure. El Plato with portobello mushroom pepper steak, $15.99 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) For a more traditional and equally hearty meal, order El Plato, a classic lunch-counter rice-and-beans platter with sweet, sticky plantains, avocado salad, and hunks of portobello done up pepper steak-style. Those plantains can also be ordered as a side, and they are caramelized to perfection. There are tostadas, tacos, nachos, loaded-up vegan mofunguitos—we could go on, and we promise you won't get bored at Next Stop Vegan. And the beverage selection is inspired, with everything from homemade juices (guava, soursop, and passion fruit) to kombucha to Coco Rico and Jarritos. Sweet plantains, $4.99 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The space itself is cute and welcoming, with lots of personal touches like plastic flowers hanging from the ceiling, chalk murals, board games, books about crystals and such, and cute dioramas starring happy animals who aren't being slaughtered and eaten. Mena and Saba are opening a vegan grocery area as well. ""Javier is the visionary,"" said Mena. ""All the little intricate details are his, bringing love and creativity to create a space where we could come together and have a good time. You're saving the planet, you're saving your health, you're saving so many animals."" The new Next Stop Vegan is located at 88 Livingston Street, between Court Street and Boerum Place, and is currently open Monday through Thursday from 11:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., on Friday and Saturday from 11:00 to 9:00 p.m., and on Sunday from 11:00 to 6:00 (917-966-6066) (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Already a user?

Start 2023 Right With Mucho Sarap’s Filipino Tacos on Canal Street,https://hellgatenyc.com/20-dinner-mucho-sarap-canal-street,265 Canal Street,Mucho Sarap (https://www.instagram.com/sosarapnyc/),"265+Canal+Street,+NYC",Mucho Sarap,40.7191119859049,-74.0008703461691,https://www.instagram.com/sosarapnyc/,,,,"The idea for Mucho Sarap, a new Filipino taco stall located inside the Canal Street Market, first started taking shape in pre-pandemic times, in the kitchen of Soho hotspot Lure Fishbar. It was there that chef VJ Navarro, who was born in Italy, and grew up in Flushing, but whose family fiercely maintains and celebrates their Filipino heritage, met his mentor, chef Neptali Mendoza, who introduced him to Mexican cooking. ""Filipino food is hard to put out there,"" Navarro told Hell Gate while ladling out some killer consome from a burbling pot. ""It's very heavy, with a lot of going on. So I thought by combining it with Mexican food, in an easy bite like tacos, more people would try it."" First, though, Navarro and his high school friend Sebastian Shan launched So Sarap, a classic Filipino street food stand (think: chicken heads, pig's blood skewers, and balut) that popped up in September of 2020 on Allen Street and has since ensconced itself at both Smorgasburg locations in Brooklyn. Don't worry, fishball fans, So Sarap is not going away. But when a booth at the newly rejuvenated Canal Street Market became available, Navarro saw it as the perfect spot to roll out his more accessible-to-the-masses concept, Mucho Sarap. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Not that the food here is timid. ""All dishes are based on Filipino food, with Mexican tortillas and sauces,"" said Navarro. ""We're trying to combine two cuisines into one without losing the flavors of either."" Taco de Nilaga, $5 (Scott Lynch / Gate) And so we have things like the Taco de Nilaga, an extremely rich and juicy Filipino stew, made here with beef short ribs, cheeks, and tongue, piled onto a decent corn tortilla and capped with lots of onion. This is terrific, especially if you dump on some of the accompanying red sauce and/or green sauce. The Consome de Nilaga is a weekend special (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) And if you come on the weekend and they're serving Consome de Nilaga, get it with a taco or two for dipping. It's one of the best bowls of anything I slurped down in 2022. Taco de Longaniza, $5 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The Taco de Longaniza is also very good, the sweet pork sausage chopped into tiny pieces and, if you choose (you should choose), topped with pickled jalapeños and onions. The taco piled with apritada, a tomato-based chicken stew, is less exciting. Definitely get the Lumpia Guac, which is as simple and fun as it sounds, just five fried, pork-filled spring rolls sticking out of a mound of creamy guacamole. Essentially: chips and dip. The avocado needs a little more oomph, however, so feel free to add that spicy red sauce, or some pickley things, or even bits of the fiery dried chiles before scooping. Lumpia Guac, $15 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Lumpia Chiladas, $15 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The Lumpia Chiladas is probably the most clever of Navarro's cuisine mashups, with the Filipino vegetable spring rolls treated as enchiladas, covered in gooey cheese, a mess of cilantro, and drenched in traditional Mexican sauce. And it's all pretty filling. Go with a buddy, get two tacos each, split one of the lumpia dishes, and you'll still have enough left over for a Jarritos or two. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The whole Canal Street Market felt festive and alive when Hell Gate went last week, with the decked-out Mucho Sarap booth leading the way. The design here is meant to evoke the Tindahan, the Filipino equivalent of the bodega, with the ""storefront"" in the back (the snacks and such hanging behind the chicken wire are just decor for now, though Navarro is actively seeking a distributor so he can sell the genuine goods) and people hanging out front on the ""sidewalk"" drinking, eating, socializing. The Mucho Sarap booth is decked out like a Tindahan, the Filipino equivalent of the bodega  (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""We're bringing the Filipino streets to New York,"" said Ariane Demesa, who is married to Navarro and called herself the Mucho Sarap spokesperson. ""Maybe we'll set up karaoke next."" (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Mucho Sarap is located within the Canal Street Market , located at 265 Canal Street, between Broadway and Lafayette, and is currently open from 11:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. daily. If you can't get one of the bright yellow stools in front of the booth there's a large communal dining area in the back of the market. Already a user? Log in Thanks for reading!

Feast on Nigerian Delights at Rockaway Beach This Summer,https://hellgatenyc.com/nigerian-delights-the-cradle-rockaway-beach,194 Beach 96th Street,The Cradle (https://www.instagram.com/thecradlenyc/?hl=en),"194+Beach+96th+Street,+NYC",The Cradle,40.5850899,-73.8177715,https://www.instagram.com/thecradlenyc/?hl=en,,,,"Jide Alao didn't start surfing until he was fifteen years old, when he and his family moved from Lagos, Nigeria, to the Rockaways. Right away, he fully embraced the scene at the surf-only stretch around Beach 69th Street, but as he told Hell Gate, ""One summer, I realized there was something missing. There's no West African food here! Having this in the Rockaways would be amazing."" So in 2019, Alao, who grew up hanging out at his mom's restaurants back in Lagos, and his wife and business partner Pesy Sikyala started selling jollof rice bowls on the boardwalk from a food cart, which they supplanted the following year with a full-fledged brick-and-mortar counter service spot on Beach 96th Street called The Cradle NYC . The Cradle on Beach 96th Street. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) He was, in turns out, correct—having this cuisine out here is, indeed, amazing, and The Cradle is an excellent addition to a stacked line-up of rad beach food options. Now entering its third summer in the original Rockaway Taco space, The Cradle serves a full menu of classic Nigerian dishes, led by a terrific egusi, a luxuriously thick West African stew whose rich flavors come from the namesake melon seed, plus locust beans, greens, crawfish, and dried fish. Alao also mixes in your choice of protein, and we opted for chicken. The best-sounding meaty add-on, ""cow foot, goat meat, and beef tripe,"" had a $3 upcharge, which would have busted our $20 Dinner budget by a buck. But you go ahead and live it up, Rockefeller. Egusi with chicken and iyan, $18. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The egusi also comes with a starchy side of okele, and your choices here are either eba, which is made from cassava flour, or iyan, a gummy ball of pounded yam from which you pull off stretchy pieces with your hand to scoop up your stew. You don't have to use your hands, of course; there are spoons and forks readily available at the counter. But as Alao told us, ""When you eat with your hands, there's a sensual bond between you and the food. You can feel the heat of the food and the texture, so it's a lot more like your whole being is coming into play. That's the beauty of eating our food."" To that end, he's installed a sink right by the outdoor dining area if you want to wash up before you dive in, fingers first. Our reporter eating with his hands, for maximum sensuality. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) All of the above can also be had with a spinach-forward stew called efo riro as the base, or with Alao's okra stew. You can also get one of the jollof rice bowls, piled high with sweet plantains, vinegary kale salad, or roasted broccoli, and your choice of salmon, chicken, or beef. Alao said that the inclusion of kale salad in the jollof was initially met with derision among Rockaway's Nigerian community, but he's since seen social media posts by those same naysayers adding it to their home-cooked meals, so who's laughing now? As Alao put it, ""I'm not saying I started a trend, but..."" Salmon jollof rice bowl, $20. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The stews and the jollof bowls are all large, filling meals, so if you want something snackier, the yuca fries, samosas, or sweet puff-puffs are the move. Alao is proud of his juice and smoothie menu as well, the latter in flavors like Jack (jackfruit, spinach, mango, banana) and Peanut Vibes (starring peanut butter and blueberries). And watch for off-menu specials on Fridays this summer, which Alao promised would highlight ""Nigerian street food, all the way, no modern twist, just authentic stuff."" Yuca fries, $3. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The Cradle can also be found at the Riis Park concessions this season, and Alao said he plans on breaking out the cart again and showing up on the streets of Brooklyn and Manhattan. ""We have a lot of regulars now,"" he said about his flagship on Beach 96th. ""People were a little standoffish at first, but now they walk by and see a diverse group eating here, which brings a sense of belonging to everyone. Like, 'Oh, I can eat here too.' It's really been fun talking to people. I really enjoy feeding my community."" The Cradle is located at 194 Beach 96th Street, between Rockaway Beach Boulevard and the Atlantic Ocean, and is currently open on Wednesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. (347-619-9120) Already a user?

NYC’s Hottest Club Is This Bonkers Hong Kong-Style Diner on Doyers Street,https://hellgatenyc.com/nycs-hottest-club-mabu-cafe-doyers,18 Doyers Street,"Mabu Cafe (https://mabucafe.com/), Mabu Cafe (https://mabucafe.com/)","18+Doyers+Street,+NYC",Mabu Cafe,40.7145739,-73.9980045,https://mabucafe.com/,,,,"Cecilia Huang, the manager here at Toronto import Mabu Cafe , said she was stunned by the long lines that appeared on Doyers Street a few weeks ago when this Hong Kong-style cha chaan teng, or casual ""tea restaurant,"" first opened in the subterranean space that used to be Sanuria. ""We didn't do any type of advertising yet,"" Huang told Hell Gate. ""This is a soft opening, and we were so surprised that so many people showed up that we got caught short-handed. We have a second floor [at street level] that we haven't even used yet because the kitchen and team want to make the food really good, instead of just making more money."" It's a scene on Doyers Street. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) A good plan! Especially since the literally, physically massive menu at Mabu Cafe is packed with dishes that not only feature three or four things all piled on top of each other, but everything is also assembled to look as cute as possible. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) It's a high-wire act for sure, but for the most part, they pull it off. This place serves some first-rate stoner food, usually involving some sort of gimmickry, in a room that leaves no opportunity for sensory overload left unexplored. If you're not cracking a smile throughout your meal here, I don't know what to tell you. Live a little! Tom yum goong seafood instant noodle soup, $15.99. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) My favorite dish, and I tried a lot of them, was probably the seafood instant noodle soup, which arrived cascading, in frozen, gravity-defying fashion, from its faux Cup Noodles container. The mussels lurking within were plump and tender, and the shrimps hanging from the side had a nice snap to them. My friendly server told me to dump everything out on the plate and pour on the orange tom yung goong sauce, which she warned me was spicy but really was only moderately so. It basically ate like a mountain of chewy, gloppy pasta, and it made me happy. It's a silly dish for sure, but you could tell that someone was paying attention in the kitchen. And there are, like, ten other variations of this dish too, the noodles laden with items like pork cracklings, satay beef, or cuttlefish balls. Molten salted egg yolk French toast with pork floss and maple syrup, $9.99. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There's a lengthy Hong Kong-style French toast / pineapple bun section of the menu, everything under ten bucks and stuffed with stuff like ""assorted meat"" or vanilla ice cream or molten salted egg yolk strewn with pork floss. This latter sandwich was terrific, all oozy and seductive with big flavors. Cheesy baked bread bowl with spaghetti and pork cutlet, $19.99. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Want more carbs? There are a half-dozen different cheese baked bread bowls available. I ordered mine loaded with spaghetti and an entire pork cutlet, hacked into bite-sized pieces, which turned out to be a little overwhelming, actually, but again, I was impressed with how much care they put into each individual component. Hog maw with chicken hot pot. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Mini hot pots are such a good idea that I'm surprised more places don't have them, though at Mabu Cafe, since all of the ingredients (a bunch of good, funky hog maw; some bright red jujube, or Chinese dates) are already burbling away in the broth when it gets to your table, it's more like a big bowl of soup sitting on a pedestal of live flames. A little dicey to have perched at the edge of your overcrowded table to be honest, but we all made it through the meal without catching fire. Deep fried squid tentacles, $8.99 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Did you think we were done? We are not done. The snacks section features rice rolls; cheese fries; and many deep fried things, including milk custard, chicken wings, and squid tentacles, served somewhat charmingly on a plastic toy of a scale. Handle these latter guys with care! The top tray part is not attached to the bottom scale part, and if you just start grabbing it haphazardly, you, like me, may end up with a lapful of cephalopod. Ice bear in a bath of coconut milk with jellies, $8.99. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) And before any of the above was eaten, dessert was served, an adorable ice bear (as in, a little teddy bear made out of ice) soaking in a bathtub of coconut milk and various jellies. A delicious and refreshing way to start a meal. There's so much more here, too, but I'll let you discover the rest. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The basement dining room (and the stairwell down to the basement dining room) is a riot of neon, random toys, advertisements, murals, posters, newspaper clippings, and accessories by brands and artists with vibes similar to Supreme and Bear Brick and Kaws. The tables are covered in mahjong tiles under glass. The bathroom is behind a refrigerator door labeled SMEG. ""The theme is like if you go to Hong Kong, this is what it was like there in the '90s,"" said Huang. ""My husband is from Hong Kong, and he said this looks exactly like the old times."" (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Mabu Cafe is located at 18 Doyers Street, close to Pell Street, and is currently open from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. daily, with dinner hours coming soon. I waited over an hour for a table starting at 2:30 in the afternoon on a weekday. Already a user? Log in Thanks for reading!

Taqueria Ramírez Serves Up Burger Brilliance in a Greenpoint Bar Basement,https://hellgatenyc.com/taqueria-ramirez-al-pastor-burger,43 Franklin Street,Ramirez Burger (https://www.instagram.com/the_mallard_drake/),"43+Franklin+Street,+NYC",Ramirez Burger,40.7277625,-73.9572458,https://www.instagram.com/the_mallard_drake/,,,,"Taqueria Ramírez opened in September of 2021 on sleepy Oak Street in Greenpoint with six different tacos on the menu, no beer, and very little seating. But as soon as word got out just how incredible their food was, there was a long-ass line down the block. Nothing's really changed at Ramírez since, including the length of the line and, relatedly, how crazy delicious everything is here. The funky tripa; the juicy al pastor; the nopales with crackling chicharron; the longaniza, which is like an amped-up chorizo; the hacked-up bits of beef, or suadero, pulled from the choricera's burbling meat orgy—spoon on some salsa, scarf these suckers down on the sidewalk, and feel the bliss wash over you. Pastor, tripa, and longaniza tacos, $5 each at Ramírez. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The line for these tacos is no joke. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Chef Giovanni Cervantes runs things at Taqueria Ramírez with his partner Tania Apolinar. And last weekend, the couple jumped into Brooklyn's burger game with a phenomenal al pastor beauty, served from a tiny window in the basement of the Mallard Drake , a bar about a block away from Ramírez. The burger window is in the basement of the Mallard Drake. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The Ramírez Burger is a monster. There are two patties, each a densely packed blend of two-thirds pork and one-third beef, seasoned with a brush of adobo and oozy with melted sharp cheddar cheese. A slice of grilled pineapple gives it that al pastor tang. There's red onion for some bite and a generous slathering of habanero aioli adds to the glorious mess. Once again: The Ramírez al pastor burger with fries at the Mallard Drake, $18. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The burger comes complete with a mountain of excellent shoestring fries, which Cervantes said he modeled after his favorites (McDonald's). There's also a vegetarian version with an Impossible patty, for two dollars more. And that's it! That's the entire food menu here at their Mallard Drake outpost, and it is awesome. Inside the Mallard Drake. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Shoot pool before you have burger hands. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The Mallard Drake is owned by Greenpoint legend Tony Petillo, who also runs Brooklyn Safehouse down the street, which is where Cervantes hosted his first-ever taco popup back in 2016. The bar has only been open since February, but it looks like it's been around for about 40 years longer than that. The space is dark, furnished with beat-up upholstered chairs, and there's an actual (rogue?) smoking area in the covered back patio. Wild stuff. The window where you order your Ramírez Burger is down in the basement, next to the free pool table. Feel free to eat wherever you want. Ramírez Burger is located in the basement of the Mallard Drake, 43 Franklin Street between Cayler and Quay Streets, and is currently open on Monday through Thursday from 5:00 p.m to 11:00 p.m., and on Saturday and Sunday from 2:00 to 11:00.

Chelsea’s Pier 57 Is a Shockingly Good Place to Eat Food and Hang Out,https://hellgatenyc.com/pier-57-food-hall-review,"25+West+11th+Avenue,+NYC","Zaab Zaab (https://zaabzaabnyc.com/), Local Roots (https://localrootsnyc.com/), Due Madri (https://www.duemadri.co/)","25+West+11th+Avenue,+NYC",Pier 57,40.7429514723793,-74.0091560151252,https://zaabzaabnyc.com/,,,,"Pier 57, a massive structure that juts out over the Hudson River around 15th Street has lived more than a century's worth of lives . It's seen maritime glory, deadly fires, rebuilding, rebranding (remember SuperPier ?), hawker market dreams , and bus storage. It was even a penal colony of sorts for a minute, when the NYPD arrested so many demonstrators at the 2004 Republican National Convention that they turned the place into a temporary detention center , dubbed ""Guantanamo on the Hudson."" In 2018, though, Google money swept onto the waterfront, as the tech behemoth took over all 630,000 square feet of the hulking structure. An epic renovation ensued, and about a month ago the whole place reopened. Most of it is the company's office space, of course, but there's also a noteworthy amount of public space, including a large and well-appointed ""living room"" with free Wi-Fi; a two-acre rooftop park; and Market 57 , a food hall with 16 vendors curated by the James Beard Foundation. You don't have to buy anything to hang out in the living room, which has spiffy couches, little seating areas, and workstations, or at the park (technically part of Hudson River Park). The park has benches along the perimeter, a grassy area, and an amphitheater setup that will soon host Tribeca Film Festival screenings. Right now, it mostly serves as a cool, quiet hang spot. In a city where it's increasingly difficult to find any sort of comfortable place to just sit and chill, no questions asked, no purchase necessary, it feels like some sort of secret privilege to lounge about at Pier 57, like this crumb of corporate largesse will get taken away from us if we act too happy about it. Skyline views from the rooftop park, open from 6:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Still, that's all good news. And if you do decide to buy something to eat while you're here, you're in luck, because several of the Market 57 vendors are serving up some exceptional food hall fare. The James Beard Foundation was in charge of assembling the Market 57 vendor lineup, and they are clearly making an effort to distance the organization from its historic preference for nominating white men for their prestigious (and potentially career-making) annual awards. I haven't tried all 16 booths, but the best thing I've eaten here so far—and one of the best dishes I've had all year—was the Langano Bowl at Ras Plant Based , an outpost of Romeo and Milka Regalli's awesome vegan Ethiopian restaurant that opened in Crown Heights right before COVID-19 hit town. This is a lively, hearty mix of sauteed seitan and various vegetables, mostly soft and stew-like, served over rice and held together by kicky sauces and the pleasant crunch of what appear to be injera croutons. It's deeply satisfying comfort food that also makes you want to congratulate yourself for eating healthy. Good job, you! Lagano Bowl from Ras Plant Based, $18. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The Ras Plant Based stand here at Pier 57 was forced to open without all of their equipment in place, so look for the Regallis to expand their menu once that all gets sorted out. Another compelling reason to cross that 11th Avenue car sewer and eat at Market 57 is the Zaab Zaab booth, an extension of the acclaimed Isaan Thai spot in Elmhurst that's been called one of the city's best restaurants. Zaab Zaab's menu is limited here in Chelsea by the lack of venting at their stand (only four vendors at Market 57 can actually cook, and the rest basically prep everything elsewhere and assemble and/or reheat on site), but they do offer the restaurant's signature dish—the insanely good duck larb, a funky and fiery pile of ground duck breast, charred galangal, chunks of fried duck liver, and crackling bits of duck skin. Served with a ball of first-rate sticky rice, it makes for a memorable meal. Duck lard from Zaab Zaab, $17. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) One of the stands that does have venting is Maiko Kyogoku's Japanese comfort food spot Bessou , and she puts the fryer to good use by cranking out some terrific karaage, or fried chicken, served either stacked high and covered in sauce or stuffed into a couple of different sandos. Also here are Kyogoku's excellent fried triangles of crispy rice, topped with sashimi or mushrooms. And if you can't decide which way to go, get one of Bessou's fun (and filling) combo options. Three-piece karaage combo with crispy rice piece from Bessou, $19. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The indefatigable ""regenerative agriculture cheerleader"" Wen-Jay Ying has a branch of her Carroll Gardens cafe Local Roots at Market 57, where, as she puts it, ""90 percent of our menu ingredients are sourced from small, local farms."" That includes an Asian chicken salad served on greens with Sichuan breadcrumbs, a vegetarian lo mein, a delicious sesame miso chocolate chip cookie, and my pick, a rich and gooey scallion pancake cheese melt with pickled onions and green goddess sauce. Scallion pancake cheese melt from Local Roots, $12. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) If you're in a meaty mood, Erika Nakamura and Jocelyn Guest's Due Madri is the spot for you. The couple, both whole animal butchers who trained with James Beard Award winner April Bloomfield, are focused here on rustic Italian sandwiches. The meats are all house-made—of course— and sandwiches feature combos like mortadella and stracciatella cheese, prosciutto and pecorino cream, braised beef and pickled radicchio, and, my dinner one night, a beautiful porchetta number drenched in salsa verde and aioli. The ""Lupa"" porchetta sandwich from Due Madri, $18.50. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Other choices at Market 57 include a taco spot called Mijo from Fanny Gerson of, among other endeavors, the great Fan-Fan Doughnuts in Bed-Stuy; Jimmy Rizvi's Ammi, featuring dosas, dal, and biryani; the ""Cape Cod and Caribbean mashup"" Lolo's on the Water, an offshoot of Harlem's Lolo's Seafood Shack ; and Good to Go by JBF, which functions as an incubator for small businesses to experiment with their fast-casual concepts. And for dessert? Hit up Malai , Pooja Bavishi's stellar ice cream shop, possibly the best in NYC, with its full menu of South Asian-inspired flavors like rose with cinnamon roasted almonds, cardamom pistachio crumble, and mango and cream, all ready for scooping. There are pints too! Bavishi has also jumped into the soft serve game, with a monthly special here at the pier that in April was saffron (delightful) and in May is masala chai (also delightful). Grab a cone, head up to the roof, and take a minute to be grateful for how good life can be. Market 57, the public ""living room,"" and the rooftop park are all located within Pier 57 at 25 West 11th Avenue, jutting out over the Hudson River at about 15th Street. Market 57 is open from 11:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m daily; the rooftop park is open from 6:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. Already a user? Log in Thanks for reading!

"For NYC’s Best Cemitas, Head to Coney Island",https://hellgatenyc.com/nycs-best-cemitas-coney-island,1221 Bowery Street,Doña Zita (https://example.com/dona-zita),"1221+Bowery+Street,+NYC",Doña Zita,40.5748665,-73.9803514,https://example.com/dona-zita,,,,"The first time I went to Doña Zita this year it was a cloudy, chilly late afternoon in early April. The amusement park rides that surround the modest takeout stand had been operating for a couple of days, but barely anyone was on them. And the sucker games that dominate what is essentially a back alley but is hilariously called ""Bowery Street"" were also hurting for, uh, suckers. So the overall vibe along the boardwalk was... not despondent, exactly (Coney will always have a certain spark), but if ever there was a day for Doña Zita's owners Raymundo Bardomiano and Dalia Vázquez, who've been out here doing this since 2003, to phone it in, or pack it up early and go home, or not bother with certain labor intensive options, this was it. Not a chance. I ordered the chorizo cemita, and it was a masterpiece. Made-to-order like everything here, the mighty beast was stuffed with funky, fiery sausage, a mountain snow-peak's worth of salty grated Oaxaca cheese, some pickled onions and chipotle, big chunks of avocado, the whole thing screaming fresh and redolent with papalo leaves, which can be described as ""cranked up cilantro."" Did I need to eat the whole thing? No. Did I do it anyway? Absolutely. Almost as good (and just as jaw-stretching) as the cemita is the Doña Zita torta, which I ate for dinner on a warm, still-sunny evening a few days later, when Bowery Street, and the rest of the boardwalk area, were much more active. Heck, even the hang-from-this-bar-for-two-minutes-and-win-money guy was attracting a crowd. Milanesa de pollo torta, $15 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Your torta choices include pulled pork, bistec, spicy beef, or Milanesa de pollo, which I got because I wanted to see if they could fry up these breaded breast filets without turning them to cardboard. And, indeed, they could. In fact, this was some of the best Milanesa I've had anywhere, the bird plenty juicy and packed with flavor. There's none of that awesome papalo on the torta, but they do pile on the Oaxaca cheese as well as avocado, jalapeno, shredded lettuce, tomato, and a slathering of refried beans. Like the cemita, this sandwich is a monster, and can easily satisfy two. Chicharron quesadilla, $15 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There are other, non-sandwich things at Doña Zita as well, like gorditas, flautas, tostadas, ""Mexican hot dogs,"" and, at a separate counter, a half dozen different tacos. My only venture into this territory (so far) was a chicharron quesadilla, which came out chewy and gooey, the fried skin-on pork bits strewn about on top retaining their crunch. The good stuff kind of gets buried under all that lettuce, though, and I couldn't figure out a way to pick up the quesadilla without spilling everything all over the picnic table. Doña Zita vibes like a funky beachside stand, sun-faded signage and all, but there's also a surprising amount of seating in the cordoned-off courtyard, plus a couple of tables inside, which seems like an ideal spot to hunker down (with a cemita) in case of a thunderstorm. There's even a bathroom back here. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Not that any of this is a secret. Doña Zita lands on just about every ""Where To Eat At Coney"" list, a bright, shining treasure placed alongside those boardwalk stalwarts whose food, let's be honest, is usually pretty terrible. In fact, this might be the only really good place to eat in the whole amusement park zone. If Doña Zita was on your block, instead across the alley from a go kart track and the Zombie Shootout booth, you'd be eating here once a week. Two important notes: Doña Zita is cash only, so save yourself a $4.50 ATM fee and come with a couple of twenties in your pocket for you and your loved one; and because everything's made to order, your wait time will be more like a full-service sit-down restaurant than a fast-food stand. Which is fine. What's the rush? You're in the ""playground of the world."" Doña Zita is located at 1221 Bowery Street, just east of Stillwell Avenue, on the way from the subway to the boardwalk.

Flushing Cold Noodle Mall-Stall Favorite Old Luo Yang Gets Its Own Storefront,https://hellgatenyc.com/flushing-cold-noodle-mall-stall-favorite-old-luo-yang-gets-its-own-storefront,135-42 39th Avenue,Old Lanzhou (https://example.com/old-lanzhou),"135-42+39th+Avenue,+NYC",Old Lanzhou,40.7600032,-73.8309068,https://example.com/old-lanzhou,,,,"Who doesn't love eating their way through the food halls of Flushing, especially the crammed and chaotic spots like Golden Shopping Mall (RIP), and the one fronted by Corner 28 on 40th Road and Landmark Quest, right near the train on Roosevelt? Heck, even the newer places like New York Mall offer tremendous culinary pleasures amid their relative gleam. That said, sometimes you want a slightly more chill vibe while, for example, you slurp up a pile of liang pi, those spongy cold skin noodles splashing around in a puddle of tangy and/or spicy sauce. So I was stoked when Caroline Shin over at Eater reported that one of Flushing's mall veterans, Old Luo Yang, recently opened a whole counter-service restaurant. Spicy cold noodle, $8.50 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Owner Yang Liu, who was born and raised in Luoyang, an industrial city in the Henan province and one of China's oldest cities, told Hell Gate that it was ""very exciting"" to have his own storefront after years of operating in tiny food hall spaces, first at New World Mall—he was one of the original tenants back in 2011—and then at Landmark, where he still operates a somewhat scruffy-looking stand. The menu at the new Old Luo Yang remains anchored by noodles, which come in several different guises. For the classic liang pi, order what they call ""regular cold noodles,"" tossed with sprouts, cucumbers, and chewy chunks of tofu. An extra jolt of tanginess is needed here, so dump on the black vinegar sauce. Regular cold noodle, $8 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) You can also get the wide, flat liang pi in orange (made with carrot), purple (sweet potato), or green (spinach), but I've found that, while visually fun and cool, these don't taste much different than the regular. The pasta in the ""spicy cold noodle"" dish, however, is in a completely different category altogether, with long strands of a thick lo mein piled high in enough chili sauce to splatter your shirtfront. The bigger kitchen at the new Old Luo Yang gives Liu the space to expand the menu, and there's a selection of stir fried cold noodles now, served actually cold or ""processed,"" which basically means just-cooked and warm. You can get these slightly-crisp, chewy beauties loaded with shredded pork, or cumin lamb, or, my choice, black pepper beef. Cumin lamb Chinese burger, $7.50; premium pork Chinese burger, $6.50 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Cumin lamb Chinese burger, $7.50 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Those meats can also all be had in sandwich format, stuffed into a flaky, buttery laminated-dough bun that you should definitely not take completely out of its waxed-paper sleeve while eating because you'll just get oily crumbs all over everything. The pork burger was too dry to really recommend, but the cumin lamb burger totally hit the spot. In fact, I'd pop in here just to grab one of these for a strolling-around snack. Another new addition to Old Luo Yang: a couple of noodle casseroles, one with beef, the other with pickled vegetables and pork, both served right from the flames in their cooking pot. Various herbal and citrus-y Chinese sodas add a pleasantly fizzy and bright complement to your meal. A look inside (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There are about ten seats at the new restaurant—some stools sit before a fairly wide eating counter when you first walk in, and on squat Ottoman-looking things at a low counter near the register in the back. Plants and wall hangings add warmth and character to a room dominated by that popular silvery gray fake brick wallpaper that always gives a jumping-to-light-speed feel to narrow spaces. Music is not happening. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The new Old Luo Yang storefront is located at 135-42 39th Avenue, between Main and Prince Streets, and is currently open daily from 10:30 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. daily.

Can the New Superiority Burger Possibly Live Up to Our Ridiculously High Expectations?,https://hellgatenyc.com/superiority-burger-lives-up-to-high-expectations,119 Avenue A,"Superiority Burger (https://www.instagram.com/superiorityburger/), Superiority Burger (https://www.instagram.com/superiorityburger/)","119+Avenue+A,+NYC",Superiority Burger,40.7264835,-73.9835089,https://www.instagram.com/superiorityburger/,,,,"Like everyone else in March of 2020, Brooks Headley, famed pastry chef, famed hardcore drummer, famed chaotic Instagram caption writer , closed his adored hole-in-the-wall vegetarian (""often accidentally vegan"") restaurant Superiority Burger for the lockdown period of the pandemic. He ran a few limited-time, limited-menu experiments during the closure, calling them Salad Days. But unlike most everyone else who was running a successful business at the time, Headley never really reopened Superiority. He did something much better instead. In the summer of 2021, Headley announced that he had signed a lease at the former home of Odessa, the iconic Ukrainian diner that was also a hangout for generations of East Village party kids, located around the corner on Avenue A. The lunch counter, with Brooks Headley sporting the paper hat. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Yes, that was nearly two years ago (or, as he put it to me as he ran around the place on Monday night, ""a million years and a thousand City licenses ago""), an excruciating wait for Superiority fans. And then last Saturday night, April 1, at 9:00 p.m., Headley opened the place to the public. And it is glorious. The new Superiority Burger sprawls, with booths and tables up front, a lunch counter and a small bar under a skylight taking up the middle part, and another whole-ass dining room in the back. Even at 5:30 on Monday evening, the place crackled with energy—everyone was excited to be there, chatting with randos at other tables, Headley's built-in sound system blasting a mix of songs you want to Shazam. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Maybe it's nostalgia talking—I've been goofing around in the East Village since the late 1970s—but it's the type of place that feels like you'll run into someone you know, or you'll find out later that someone you know was there when you were also there but you didn't see them. It's punk rock. It's families and late-night drunks. It's a love letter to the neighborhood. It oozes old-school New York City cool. The space is decor-ed to within an inch of its life, but Headley's not just filling walls for an overall effect; there's a story, or a dumb joke, behind every photograph, every piece of art, every goofy sign. From the brilliant and hilarious exterior signage to the ad-supported placemats to the subtly relevant posters in the bathroom, it's all part of a package. No spoilers from me though. Look around and discover it for yourself. It will take many visits to take it all in. The namesake Superiority Burger, $13 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Which is good news, because while the food at Superiority Burger was always stellar, the food at the new Superiority is somehow even better. The eponymous veggie burger, for example, which I first ate on Christmas morning in 2014 , when Headley did a pop-up in what was then the old Dirt Candy space and would later become SB1 , seems sturdier, more robust (the roasted tomato really punches this thing up) and more perfectly balanced than ever. Yuba-Verde, $19. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) That said, my favorite sandwich at the old place is probably still my favorite sandwich at the new place, the Yuba-Verde hero: a soft, toasted roll packed with chewy tofu skin, bitter broccoli rabe, crumbly grilled chickpeas, and Matouk's mayo for some gloppiness. I always forget that it's spicy too! This used to be an infrequent special, then an off-menu item; now it's a front-and-center superstar. Collard greens sandwich, $16. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) But maybe the collard greens sandwich is my favorite? This is another monster, a slab of Superiority's famous focaccia overflowing with tender braised greens and melted Cooper Sharp cheese, which is like an American/cheddar hybrid. So creamy and sexy. The fourth sandwich on the opening menu here is the Sloppy Dave (née Sloppy Joe), an OG Headley classic. Burnt broccoli salad, $10.50. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There's a ton of action in the side dishes area of the menu. The delicious burnt broccoli salad has made the trip over to Avenue A and is looking fly piled high on an actual dish. It's a little jarring to be honest, but wholly welcome, to be served these familiar items on real plates and bowls and while sitting on a chair, when for so many years we wolfed everything down from cardboard containers while squatting on that tree box on Ninth Street. Spicy lentils and cornbread, $11.50. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) I also loved the new-to-me spicy lentils with charred cabbage and cornbread, which ate like a soup. There are two potato dishes that look equally rad, a weird-sounding beets concoction with pretzels and cream cheese, some cute lettuce cups stuffed with ground soy burger, and fried rice and beans, which is pretty much a guaranteed winner. And so many desserts! Pastry chef Darcy Spence has really upped her offerings at the new space. There are about a dozen different treats available, including a gelato/sorbet combo; a couple of cakes; a malted date shake; fried-to-order funnel cake; griddled banana bread; a slice of superb peanut butter pie; and the showstopper of the night, the ""pearl pie,"" made with a graham cracker crust, coconut custard, mango, pureed plum, and spoonfuls of tadpole-egg-looking tapioca spilling all over the place. Pearl pie, $13. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Peanut butter pie, $15. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) A note on the prices: Superiority Burger was maybe a genuine $20 Dinner sort of spot when it first opened in 2015, but even before the pandemic, I always spent considerably more than that here, getting at least three things and also dessert. And the prices on Avenue A, unsurprisingly, are higher, with even more great stuff to tempt you to over order. Nothing is more than $19, but nothing is less than $10.50. Plus, there's booze, if that's your thing. Cocktails are $17, glasses of wine start at $10, bottles top out at $75, and beer averages around $7 a can. The bar area. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The front dining room has booths and tables. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) But even if it costs ""regular"" restaurant prices to eat here now, it still feels like a miracle that there's this exciting, expansive new Superiority Burger that we can all go to and sit down and stuff ourselves silly with all this incredible food and it will still be here tomorrow too, and the day after that, and maybe even forever. It's really good news, and I'm going to enjoy it. Superiority Burger is located at 119 Avenue A, between East 7th and St Marks Place, and is currently open on Thursday through Monday from 5:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight. Expect these hours to expand in both directions in the coming weeks and months. The line outside right before opening at 5:00 on Monday, but don't worry, there are lots of tables inside (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Already a user? Log in Thanks for reading!

If You Want a Taste of Heaven You Must Go to East Williamsburg,https://hellgatenyc.com/if-you-want-a-taste-of-heaven-you-must-go-to-east-williamsburg,251 Jackson Street,Evelia’s (https://example.com/evelias),"251+Jackson+Street,+NYC",Evelia’s,40.7171407,-73.9405452,https://example.com/evelias,,,,"Tony and Melody Vergara—husband and wife, small business co-owners, and ""Chef One and Chef Two,"" as Melody puts it—had zero experience running a restaurant when they first opened Taste of Heaven in East Williamsburg in 2015. Tony, who grew up in the Cooper Park Houses nearby, had already made it through a whole career as a truck driver. Melody, raised in the Red Hook Houses, just finished her 25 years as a NYC Corrections Officer. The couple were also busy all those years raising four children, the eldest of whom is now 36. So, by the time they got to 2015, starting a business as demanding as a restaurant didn't really seem like the next obvious step. But as Melody told Hell Gate last week, ""Tony's passion has always been cooking. The day that I met him he told me wanted to open a restaurant."" When the opportunity to realize his dream unexpectedly dropped into their laps, they knew they had to take it, retirement be damned. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""The landlord of this place approached Tony, and basically gave it to him,"" Melody said of the location that was once a laundromat, a game room, and a church. ""He wanted to give the space to someone who appreciated the neighborhood. And Tony's been very involved in this community for a long time, organizing things like basketball tournaments and back-to-school giveaways. He's very well liked, and very well known out here."" ""It's a whole new career for both of us,"" Melody continued. ""But I believe in dreams, and this is it. If God gives you something that you want, and it's everything you always wanted, you can't say no."" The small jerk chicken dinner with rice and peas, cabbage, and cornbread, $12 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Taste of Heaven is a counter service steam table spot that serves overflowing plates of classic comfort food. First you choose your main, which usually means some excellent pork ribs, turkey wings, or chicken legs and thighs, all of which are roasted until the meat slides right off the bone. These are available with either BBQ sauce, some punchy jerk seasoning, or Jack Daniels sauce, which doesn't have any booze in it here and is sweet like teriyaki. Fish sandwich, $10 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) You get two sides with your meat (""small"" dinners are $12 and are actually large; ""large"" dinners are $15 and huge), and there are a bunch from which to choose. Hell Gate wolfed down collard greens, some creamy mac and cheese, a mini-mountain of rice and peas, and a bunch of sweet cabbage with our dinners, and would recommend any of these to you. Other choices for sides on the day we went included candied yams, string beans, and potato and macaroni salad. You also get a slab of sticky cornbread with every meal, so make sure you're hungry when you arrive. There's shrimp and some good fish here too, probably pollack, cornmeal-battered and fried to order, though the ""sandwich"" was three folded-over filets between two slices of bread, no condiments or toppings—so maybe get the dinner instead. Specials change daily, so you may or may not see oxtail, short ribs, shepherd's pie, lasagna, or rasta pasta on the menu. The quality of everything is high and consistent, so follow your cravings. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Taste of Heaven is very much a community hang, even after the pandemic forced the Vergaras to remove most of the indoor seating and rearrange the interior layout. By weird coincidence, on the day I ate here a TikTok featuring the place had just racked up tons of views, so there were more new faces than usual. But for the most part, everyone who walked in greeted Tony and Melody by name. ""I want people to feel at home here,"" Melody said. ""Because that's what it is, this is like home for us. There's a lot of love here, and we want everyone to feel welcome."" (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Taste of Heaven is located at 251 Jackson Street in East Williamsburg, just west of Kingsland Avenue, and is currently open on Tuesday through Friday from 12:00 noon to 7:00 p.m., and on Saturday from 1:00 to 7:00.

Nigerian Street Food Meets Fast Food on Nostrand Avenue,https://hellgatenyc.com/nigerian-street-food-akara-house,642 Nostrand Avenue,"Grub Street (https://www.grubstreet.com/2023/03/akara-house-sandwich.html), Akara House (https://www.akarahouse.com/), Akara House (https://www.akarahouse.com/)","642+Nostrand+Avenue,+NYC",Grub Street,40.6764452,-73.9501033,https://www.grubstreet.com/2023/03/akara-house-sandwich.html,,,,"When Funso Akinya was growing up in Nigeria, in a small town about a three hour drive from Lagos, fried bean fritters known as akara were a street food staple, usually purchased in the early morning, packed up with some bread on the side, and brought to school or work for lunch. Akinya moved to Brooklyn in the early aughts—he's lived in Crown Heights for the last dozen years—and immediately got into the hospitality business. ""I've always been a lucky guy to work in the food industry,"" he told Hell Gate. ""My first job was at McDonald's, in my second week in America. The food there tasted really good."" Instant fast-food fandom aside, Akyina's memories of his childhood favorites refused to dim, but it wasn't until a couple of years ago that he seriously considered opening his own restaurant. ""I started thinking about the vegan and vegetarian community in Brooklyn,"" he said, ""and I realized that akara, which is a plant-based food, could be part of that. I realized that I could turn it into a sandwich."" And so, as Chris Crowley first reported over at Grub Street , Akinya turned the street fritters of his youth into full-fledged veggie burgers, selling his newly-invented akara sandwich out of a former Kennedy's Fried Chicken on Nostrand Avenue, now called Akara House . ""This is a Nostrand Avenue special,"" Akinya said. ""Ketchup and mayo and pickles and cheese? They don't do it like this in Nigeria. This is American style."" Funso Akinya does everything here, so it's definitely not ""fast"" food (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Akinya's creation actually vibes more faux chicken sandwich than veggie burger (he told me he ate at Popeye's every night for three months, ""trying to figure out how to capture the chicken"") the black-eyed pea mixture fried to a slightly crisp crust, slathered in mayonnaise, with cucumber slices (not pickles) on bottom and unmelted American cheese up top. It's a good sandwich made great by the bread, a chewy Nigerian agege roll that Akinya has specially made by a baker in Georgia. And if you really want to elevate this plant-based beast into a memorable meal, be sure to get a side of the sweet-and-spicy ata dindin pepper sauce, and dump it on with abandon. Two of these sandwiches will cost you $10, a total bargain, though it's important to note that Akinya fries up each patty to order, and it's not a speedy process. Steak suya with fried rice and kale, $14.89 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There are other tasty, filling options at Akara House as well. The nutty, peppery, charred to hell steak suya is nearly jerky-like in its gnawability, and can be had over a pile of classic Nigerian jollof rice, or with some yellow fried rice studded with vegetables. Steamed veggie moi moi, $7 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) You can also get chicken suya and rice here, or, keeping it plant-based, a banana leaf blanketing a mound of moi moi, which features essentially the same ingredients as akara, but it's steamed rather than fried, so the texture is more like a pudding.  All of these dishes get a nice jolt from that ata dindin. Ogi porridge, made with corn and infused with honey, $3.15 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There's was only one beverage available when I went last week, a homemade lemonade that appeared to also have a fair amount of oranges in the mix, and no dessert, though Akinya's ogi porridge, nominally a breakfast food and made here with corn and infused with honey, did the trick in that department. There are two stools before a narrow counter by the front window, and a couple of chairs set up on the sidewalk. If the weather's nice, Brower Park or St. Andrews Playground, both just a few blocks away, are pleasant places for a quick picnic. And though Akinya may have invented this particular version of the akara sandwich, he's hesitant to take credit for too much. ""I don't own the food,"" he said. ""It's not my food. Akara has been around since before I was born. The glory goes to those women back home that I witnessed growing up, doing this every morning on the street, because it's not an easy job. Every time I lose focus I look towards them, and get my energy from them."" (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Akara House is located at 642 Nostrand Avenue, between Bergen and Dean Streets, and is currently open from 11:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. on weekdays, until 12:00 midnight on Saturday, and until 7:00 p.m. on Sunday. Hours may vary, however. It's mostly a one-man operation right now, so if Akinya needs to be elsewhere, or runs out of food, the gate goes down. Already a user? Log in Thanks for reading!

Hell Yeah: Chinatown Mainstay Big Wong Expands to Williamsburg,https://hellgatenyc.com/big-wong-hits-williamsburg,80 Wythe Avenue,Big Wong (https://hellgatenyc.com/big-wong-hits-williamsburg),"80+Wythe+Avenue,+NYC",Big Wong,40.7219264,-73.9580961,https://hellgatenyc.com/big-wong-hits-williamsburg,,,,"Big Wong has been holding it down on Mott Street since before you were born (probably), slinging juicy roast meats laid over rice or atop gloriously greasy noodles to legions of locals, tourists, and drunk cheap-eats seekers from all over the city. In other words, it's a Chinatown Cantonese classic. My first Big Wong feast was likely in 1982 or so, almost certainly after too much (or just enough!) drinking, and there have been many more meals there ever since. The place has never been bestowed with quite the same iconic accolades as its fellow Mott Street eateries Hop Kee and Wo Hop or the nearby Great NY Noodletown, but it's always been a favorite of mine in the neighborhood for a quick and satisfying, somewhat nostalgia-laden bite. Which is why I was excited to see that the owners of Big Wong were expanding outside of Chinatown. But would a second Big Wong feel the same, especially if it's located in, say, prime Williamsburg, on North 5th just off Bedford? An area, as Curbed put it recently , that has already moved beyond its ""Soho-ish wave of gentrification"" and into its ""Fifth Avenue era""? The short answer is, no, it doesn't feel the same. But also, it doesn't matter, because the food here is great. And the prices, while higher than what you're used to on Mott Street, still sit firmly in $20 Dinner territory. Plus, in a Big Wong first, they've added dim sum to the mix at their Brooklyn outpost. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""We're dedicated to preserving some traditions of Chinese food, especially Cantonese style,"" Big Wong's owner Bill Li told Hell Gate. ""You know, many of today's customers came as kids, and we hope that this happiness can pass from generation to generation."" My usual order, Big Wong's sweet and satisfying roast pork, definitely made me happy, and can be had over white rice (add on crisp bok choy for $2.50 extra), or in fried rice, or with lo mein, or crunchy fried noodles, or in an omelet with gravy, or stirred into some thick congee, or dumped into a bowl of noodle soup. Roast pork with rice, $12, plus pak choy, $2.50 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) That noodle soup provides an excellent base for Big Wong's fatty, funky roast duck, and, after shaking on lots of salt and pepper, the congee worked nicely with chopped beef. (Chili oil is also available, if you want to perk things up further.) Congee with chopped beef, $8 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There are at least 25 different dim sum options, from crab meat soup dumplings to vegetarian spring rolls to a pan-fried Philly cheese steak mini bun. We went for the plump, shrimpy ""Sui Mai Emperor"" dumplings, and they really hit the spot. Seems like they have this dim sum stuff down. There's so much more here too. Barbecued spare ribs. Shredded pork with pickled cabbage. Beef with black bean garlic sauce. Salt and pepper pork chops. Mapo tofu. Chicken with broccoli. Hot and sour soup. Heck, even that old warhorse chop suey makes an appearance. Sui Mai Emperor, $8.95 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The exterior signage maintains the look of its original Chinatown storefront, and continues to have the head-on ducks hanging in the front window. Inside, however, the energy quickly dies. There's nothing on the walls, no music playing, and the lighting is waiting-room harsh. The service is certainly warm and welcoming, but they may want to pump up the vibes a bit so that pop-in guests stick around. Still, it's exciting to see restaurants like Big Wong open up new locations throughout the city—the classics are classics for a reason. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The Williamsburg Big Wong is located at 135B North Fifth Street, between Bedford Avenue and Berry Street, and is currently open from 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. daily (929-489-3539) Already a user?

Lovely’s Old Fashioned Is Slinging Old-School Comfort Food Into the Night in Hell’s Kitchen,https://hellgatenyc.com/lovelys-old-fashioned-burger-fries-hells-kitchen,642 Ninth Avenue,Lovely’s Old Fashioned (https://example.com/lovelys-old-fashioned),"642+Ninth+Avenue,+NYC",Lovely’s Old Fashioned,40.7603697,-73.9909505,https://example.com/lovelys-old-fashioned,,,,"There's no shortage of new restaurants with a retro feel around town these days, evoking everything from classic diners and luncheonettes to pizza joints and Hong Kong cafes . Comfort food that's better (and sometimes much better) than it needs to be, smiley service that still exudes that NYC cool, a general ""oooooh look at this cute spot!"" vibe—is this the hottest food trend of 2023? I don't know yet! But here's another recent opening to add to the list of old-school overachievers— Lovely's Old Fashioned , a lunch counter-esque place in the heart of Hell's Kitchen that serves a tight menu of burger shop classics and stays open until at least midnight. And, as is true at the most successful of these sorts of spots, there's definitely a labor-of-love element to the proceedings. ""I've been a chef for about three decades, at fancy restaurants or big restaurants,"" Lovely's co-owner Adam Schop told Hell Gate. ""But I've always wanted to have an old-fashioned hamburger shop. My grandmother Charlotte used to buy chunks of beef and grind it right at the table for me, like with one of those iron pewter kind of deals. It would take her longer to clean the grinder than to cook the one burger she grinded for me! She did that every day. It's one of my fondest memories. She used to hand cut her french fries too."" Sidewinder fries, $5. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Like Schop's grandma, Lovely's grinds its own meat daily. And the burger here is great, the patty falling into that ""just-right"" size between those ubiquitous skinny smashburgers and the $30 jaw-stretchers you find on the city's tonier menus. It's griddled to a slight char, still a bit juicy, and topped with melted American cheese if you choose, plus raw onion, pickles, mayo (ketchup is available in packets, and should be utilized), all on a soft, buttered bun. You can order it as a double, or add a couple of strips of chewy bacon like I did, but it's also pretty perfect just as it is. Patty melt, $8.75. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There's a patty melt too, and it's a beauty, the beef smothered in grilled mushrooms and onions, lots of gooey Swiss cheese, pickles, and ""Charlotte sauce"" on a nice marble rye. The vegetarian version of this is called the ""Mushrooben,"" and features a shitload of pastrami-seasoned fungi, Swiss, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing. And don't sleep on Lovely's all-beef ""Snappy Dog,"" which arrives with so much griddled sauerkraut and onions on top that you think, ""Wow, that looks like too much griddled sauerkraut and onions on top,"" but then you eat it and you realize it's actually exactly the right amount. Lovely's ""Snappy Dog,"" $7.75. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Whatever else you get, get the fries, which are crisp, fluffy, salty as hell, and cut sidewinder-style, a shape I've neither seen nor heard of before, but which Schop aptly describes as ""steak fries for nine years olds."" Onion rings are available as well. For dessert, there are mini bundt cakes, and the star of the beverage selection is without question the super-sweet Kutztown red cream soda. Pistachio chocolate bundt cakes, $5.50 each. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Lovely's, which opened in March, is the latest addition to Schop's Ninth Avenue mini-empire, which includes Zillions Pizza on 42nd Street (""right in between two pot dispensaries,"" he noted), and Steak Frites Bistro at 38th Street. There's not much room for decor here at Lovely's—there are just 10 seats at the counter inside, plus a couple of standing tables on the sidewalk—but I do dig the ghost sign on the main wall. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Lovely's Old Fashioned is located at 642 Ninth Avenue, just north of 45th Street, and is currently open on Sunday through Wednesday from noon to midnight, and on Thursday through Saturday from noon to 1 a.m. (646-918-6019) (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Already a user?

Mad Ramen Scientists Reign at Long Island City’s Instant Noodle Factory,https://hellgatenyc.com/long-island-city-instant-noodle-factory,24-11 41st Avenue,Instant Noodle Factory (https://example.com/instant-noodle-factory),"24-11+41st+Avenue,+NYC",Instant Noodle Factory,40.752602,-73.9392897,https://example.com/instant-noodle-factory,,,,"Instant Noodle Factory, which opened at the end of June in Long Island City, is a lot of fun. It offers a really good, satisfying meal starring the headliner ingredient, but be prepared: there are a bunch of steps you have to navigate before you can start slurping. Get ready to make some serious decisions—and to cook your own food. ""I'm originally from Hong Kong,"" said Tat Lee, who co-owns the place with his partner Sierra Beck, ""and we love instant noodles. Similar concepts to this exist in Asia, mainly in Korea and Thailand, but they're more basic. We wanted to make it more of an experience here."" Behold: the noodle wall. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) That experience starts at the noodle wall, where 88 different varieties, imported from at least seven countries, are mounted for your selection. These are somewhat helpfully divided into categories, like seafood, spicy, miso, and cheese. But if you, like me, are a little rusty in your instant noodle knowledge, this part of the process might be a bit overwhelming. Things have changed a lot in this market since I was scarfing 25 cent packs of Nissin Top Ramen with a pint of cottage cheese stirred in during those beery, bleary 1980s. My semi-disastrous creation, before cooking: white sesame Tseng noodles, corn, furikake, gyoza, egg, and spam, $14. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Then it's onto the toppings, of which there are also many. You can pile on the free stuff (kimchi, corn, ghost pepper), add proteins ($2 for chicken franks, $3 for tofu, $5 for beef birria), and premium items like pork shumai ($2.50), fish cakes ($1.50), and American cheese (50 cents). Maybe open your Notes app to keep track of your choices? Because next up is the touchscreen ordering monitor, at which you'll have to scroll around and find everything again. If that sounds too stressful to deal with, especially when there's only a single order screen and a line of people waiting behind you, you can instead simply select one of the eight preset combo bowls, including the ""Duck Duck Noods""—with a duck broth, pulled duck leg, scallions, plus a soft-boiled egg—and a classic tonkotsu with chashu, marinated egg, and nori. The noodle-cooking machine in action. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Did you think your work was done? Not even close. After ordering via machine, you mill around for a moment until a runner—the first Instant Noodle Factory employee you'll have interacted with since you walked in—appears from behind the back curtain bearing a brick of uncooked noodles in an induction bowl, plus whatever toppings you chose and the seasoning packets, all neatly arranged on tray with starburst-shaped note indicating which numbered button to push on what I guess you'd call the cooking machine. The bowl fits snugly in the grooved base of the apparatus, the correct amount of boiling water spurts down, and the timer kicks in. It's suggested that you stir your noodles three times while cooking, so pay attention. It's also suggested that, before assembling, you dump your excess, scalding-hot liquid into a garbage can. Not a sink or a drain, just a straight-up, plastic-bagged garbage can. How is that not a disaster waiting to happen? The massive Ramdon combo, featuring two noodle packs, after cooking, $13. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Fearing panic at the kiosk, I tried two of Instant Noodle Factory's preset combos, and both were excellent. The ramdon, also known as jjapaguri and perhaps familiar to fans of the movie ""Parasite,"" comes with two seperate noodle packs (one with blackbean sauce, the other spicy seafood flavored), plus slabs of brisket and scallions. It's a big, beefy, sticky, slippery meal. The Mala Madness combo, after cooking and mixing, $8.50. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The Mala Madness combo bowl was just as hearty and even more perky, the spicy chicken-flavored Buldak brand noodles served with slices of cheddar jalapeño sausage, Sichuan peppercorns, and finely grated parmesan. Great stuff. I would have killed for either of these dishes instead of that cottage cheese nonsense I was eating in my youth. My Frankenstein's monster, $14. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) My own creation at Instant Noodle Factory was, shall we say, less successful, which I attribute to just hitting random ingredients on the screen because there was a line of like ten people waiting and I didn't want anyone to hate me for taking too long. It was also my most expensive bowl, with white sesame Tseng brand noodles, corn, furikake, gyoza, egg, Spam, and probably a couple of other things. Like I said, it was a bit stressful, but having just one touchscreen helps keep the staff in the back from getting too swamped with orders. Inside Instant Noodle Factory. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""Long Island City is our home,"" Beck told Hell Gate. ""We thought people here would be really open to the instant noodle restaurant concept, and so far everyone's really, really enjoyed it. In fact, we hope to expand one day. We've had a lot of people tell us, 'I live in Manhattan, open one over here,' and we hope to go there next."" Seat yourself wherever you can. There are three tables near the window, and a long counter running along one wall fronted with stools. Be a hero and bring a small pair of scissors with you to cut open the little plastic packets of dry or wet seasonings, then throw in all the additional stuff, and now you are ready to eat. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Instant Noodle Factory is located at 24-11 41st Avenue, between 24th and Crescent Streets, and is currently open on weekdays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. for lunch, and then again from 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. for dinner, and on Saturday and Sunday from 11:30 to 8:30 straight through.

Astoria’s Popular Takeout Spot FoodStruck Finally Reopens as a Sit-Down Restaurant,https://hellgatenyc.com/astorias-popular-takeout-spot-foodstruck-finally-reopens-as-a-sit-down-restaurant,3093 38th Street,FoodStruck (https://example.com/foodstruck),"3093+38th+Street,+NYC",FoodStruck,40.7619008,-73.9176063,https://example.com/foodstruck,,,,"Back in 2019, when long-time Astoria resident and hospitality vet Ravi Thapa first opened FoodStruck , the tiny takeout spot operated with the nostalgia-inducing pre-pandemic hours of midnight to 4:00 a.m.—and sometimes it didn't open until 2:00 a.m.!—catering to the community of restaurant and bar workers coming home from their shifts in the city. Soon, Thapa and his then-partner Eric Dela Cruz gradually expanded their operation—non-night owls heard about their awesome chicken thighs and chopped cheese sandwiches and demanded equal access. It felt like something big was happening with FoodStruck... until COVID-19 shut it all down. FoodStruck's new storefront. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Thapa and, for a time, Dela Cruz tried to regroup and signed a lease on a space nearby with enough room to become an actual sit-down restaurant. ""We thought we were going to open in August of 2020,"" Thapa told Hell Gate. ""But the pandemic was so much bigger than anyone expected, and permits took forever."" Finally, after more than three years of bureaucratic and logistical nightmares, FoodStruck is slinging its sloppy delights once again, this time with more ""regular"" hours and seating for about 20 people on 38th Street, just off 31st Avenue. Inside FoodStruck. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) FoodStruck is still technically in soft-open mode, mostly because the new chef, Giovanni Beneduci, is traveling at the moment. For now, the core menu is being competently executed by Thapa and features all the old favorites from the late-night days. Thapa's boneless fried chicken thighs, for example, are superb, all tender and juicy and sticky with a soy tamarind glaze, then topped with crispy garlic and spicy mayo. You can get the bird either stuffed into a sandwich or laid across a bed of chewy rice, and either way you will definitely be happy. Fried chicken thighs over rice, aka the ""Big Will,"" $15. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) FoodStruck's first-rate chopped cheese is stripped down to its essence: just a mountain of seasoned ground beef, fried onions, and lots of melted cheddar, unencumbered by lettuce, tomato, or any sort of sauce, though you can (and should) get a little crock of ketchup on the side for a hit of acid. Other sandwiches include a grilled three-cheese beast, a double burger (which you can also get over rice), and—sleeper hit alert—the ""pretty fungi,"" a deeply satisfying fried shiitake and oyster mushroom creation co-starring brown butter and blobs of burrata buried within a trio of sweet Hawaiian rolls. The Pretty Fungi sandwich, $12. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) A side of rosemary and garlic fries will still keep you within our $20 Dinner budget, as will a small order of FoodStruck's terrific poutine tater tots, crunchy potato nuggets and melty mozzarella drenched in brown gravy. Poutine tater tots, $8. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) It's a lot, but there's also a lot more to come. Thapa is already rolling out specials like last weekend's ""peppered ribeye and tater tot pancake"" sandwich, and a whole new brunch menu should be dropping soon, as well as slightly lighter fare like salads and cold noodles. In the fall, once chef Beneduci is fully ensconced in the new place, Thapa told us that they plan on serving an ""upscale casual tasting menu"" on select nights inside. The room is L-shaped, mostly windowless, and a little close; it probably feels cozy and slightly secret after dark, but on a pleasant evening you may want to sit outside. Thapa hopes to sell beer and wine soon, and get a full liquor license as quickly as possible after that. Until then, the Fever Tree ginger beer has a nice bite to it. FoodStruck is located at 3093 38th Street, just north of 31st Avenue, and is currently open on Wednesday and Thursday from 5:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., on Friday from 5:00 p.m. to midnight, on Saturday from 4:00 p.m. to midnight, and on Sunday from 4:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Already a user?

Feast on Killer Puerto Rican Specialties by the Banks of the Gowanus Canal,https://hellgatenyc.com/killer-puerto-rican-food-at-kiosko-787-gowanus,787 is located at 488 Carroll Street,The Sazon Experience (https://example.com/sazon-experience),"787+is+located+at+488+Carroll+Street,+NYC",The Sazon Experience,40.6769277,-73.9860938,https://example.com/sazon-experience,,,,"Al Rosario grew up by the Gowanus Canal, the Superfund site that has, improbably, seen a luxury construction boom in recent years on its still quite fetid shores. But though the landscape has changed a lot since he was a kid, Rosario told us that one thing has remained a constant: his desire to bring really good Puerto Rican food to the neighborhood. ""I'm trying to bring Puerto Rican flavors back to Brooklyn,"" Rosario told Hell Gate. ""It's something that I've always wanted to do. There was a large Puerto Rican influence here growing up, and people love the way I cook. They say, 'Hey man, you should open a restaurant!' I have a love for food, I have a love for my culture, so here I am."" Outside of Kiosko 787. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""Here"" is the delightful Kiosko 787 , a brightly adorned spot—dig that second-floor phony facade, complete with a Juliet balcony—that Rosario opened six weeks ago on Carroll Street. The restaurant boasts an impressively lengthy menu of Puerto Rican classics, many of which, he says, are hard to find in New York City. ""The recipes belong to myself, my wife, and our families,"" Rosario said. ""They come from the island, so it's not going to be the typical stuff. Authentic Puerto Rican food, you just don't find this anymore, and people miss it."" Arroz mamposteao with pork belly and sweet plantains, $17.95. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The core of the Kiosko 787 experience are the jartera platters, which basically translates to ""you're going to need a nap after eating these."" There's pernil, of course, served with rice and beans, though Rosario slow cooks the pig for maximum tenderness and then shreds it, like pulled pork. A steak and onions entree comes with garlicky tostones, or order the mountain of excellent mamposteao. The latter is a dish sometimes disparagingly called ""leftover stew""—it's rice, chunks of pork belly, and sweet plantains, all spiced up and mixed together in delicious fashion—that Rosario says is common in Puerto Rico, but not often found on menus here. Empanadilla trio, $12.95. Pictured are the picadillo, pastelon, and camarones criollo. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) All of the above are extremely splittable, as are the monster sandwiches, which arrive hot and greasy, pressed on soft, chewy loaves of pan de agua that Rosario gets delivered a few times a week from a baker in Connecticut. You can get these beauties stuffed with steak, onions, cheese, and potato stix, or with pernil, or with roast pork, ham, cheese, mustard, and pickles, aka ""el primo Cubano."" Wepa tripleta sandwich, $17.95. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) These all sound great, but we went with the wepa tripleta, stacked with steak, ham, and roast pork, then finished with a homemade mayonnaise and ketchup mix and topped with potato stix. A glorious mess! The tidier among us can order all of this piled on top of taro root fries instead of in a sandwich, and eat it with a fork. (Don't be surprised if you're compelled to shout out ""WEEEEEEEEHPAAA!"" after your first bite.) Alcapurria, $4.95. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) For something snackier, or as a side, the empanadillas at Kiosko 787 are superb, especially the saucy, spicy shrimp one and the pastelon, which is filled with beef, sweet plantain, and mozzarella. And don't sleep on the crispy fried alcapurria, a plantain fritter filled with picadillo. No matter what, pour on one or several of Rosario's homemade hot sauces, which he started making as a hobby in his kitchen before Kiosko 787 even existed. Those sauces come in flavors like tamarind, passion fruit, guava, and, for a serious kick, straight-up aji peppers. Al Rosario's homemade hot sauces. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) As its name suggests, Kiosko 787 is very much a takeout operation, though Rosario has set up a few card tables and folding chairs on the sidewalk out front; these make for a comfortable spot while you feast. Beverages are nonalcoholic, and the clear winner among them is the can of Good-O brand's iconic Kola Champagne. Kiosko 787 is located at 488 Carroll Street, just off Third Avenue, and is currently open on Tuesday through Saturday from noon to 8 p.m., and on Sunday from noon to 7 p.m. Already a user?

Funzi’s Pizzeria Brings Top-Tier Slices to St. Marks Place,https://hellgatenyc.com/funzis-pizzeria-brings-excellent-slices-to-st-marks-place,36 St. Marks Place,Manhattan Special (https://www.manhattanspecial.com/),"36+St.+Marks+Place,+NYC",Manhattan Special,40.7288145822735,-73.9882265378962,https://www.manhattanspecial.com/,,,,"Kevin Cox, the owner of Funzi's Pizzeria , which just opened on the busiest stretch of St. Marks Place, is the first to admit that making great pizza is really fucking hard. ""I've opened a lot of restaurants over the last 11 years here in NYC, but it's been primarily burger places and Japanese food places,"" Cox told Hell Gate. ""Pizza is much more difficult. There are so many variables that go into making dough the correct way, and making it consistent throughout the year, as the humidity rises, the temperature changes."" Burrata and pepperoni slices, $4.99 each. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) That's where chef James Jaworski comes in. Cox met Jaworski when he was looking at a location in Williamsburg—a deal that fell through when another pizzeria opened right across the street—and was blown away by his pies. ""After I tasted chef James's food, I knew that we could do something special,"" he said. So when the St. Marks spot opened up, Cox pounced. Outside of Funzi's. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Jaworski has a strong pizza pedigree. He worked at the Italian restaurant Pasquale Jones right after graduating from the Culinary Institute of America, and then with Massimo Laveglia at the great L'Industrie Pizzeria , before joining Cox in the East Village. And, it turns out, he delivers—the pizza at Funzi's is terrific, instantly snagging the joint a spot in the top tier of NYC slice shops. The burrata slice, for example, is a worthy replica of what you'd get at L'Industrie—a straight-up gooey, creamy, salty, sexy delight. The pepperoni slice rules as well, all chewy and cheesy and funky. It also showcases the structural integrity of Jaworski's pizza: These are classic NYC folds, with a tangy crust that's just firm and crisp enough to hold the toppings with authority. Burrata slice, $4.99. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Pepperoni slice, a classic NYC fold, $4.99. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The sleeper hit at Funzi's, and one of the best things I've eaten this year, is the chicory slice, which Jaworski makes with fresh dandelion greens, a lovely dandelion cream, and a whole mess of bacon lardons on top, served with a slice of lemon on the side for squirting. It's a journey for sure, and it's delicious. Chicory and lardon slice, $4.99. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Other pizza choices include plain cheese, tomato (no cheese) and white (no tomato). Jaworski also messes around with a bunch of different fried pasta dishes, which are served crackling on the outside and molten within. The fried lasagna I had over the Fourth of July weekend was decent, and I'm stoked to try his cacio e pepe. There are a couple of ancillary dishes as well: a garlicky tangle of sautéed greens, and an enormous, juicy Caesar salad with enough anchovies to keep the party popping. Caesar salad, $12. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Beverage choices are limited to Coke and Manhattan Special coffee soda, which always hits with a lot more strength and bitterness than I remember. For dessert, there's icebox cake in rotating flavors—I had vanilla soaked pineapple with coconut—that eats like a mound of whipped cream. Pineapple coconut icebox cake, $7. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) As for the space, it's wild. Its vibe is distinctly retro—Cox calls the style ""Americana""—but it's so packed with random stuff that it's tough to pin it down to any specific era or sensibility. A framed illustration of eyelash-batting seals hangs next to a print of the Mona Lisa, which is next to an action shot of Michael Jordan (what, were there no posters of Reggie Miller lying around?), which is near a corny-ass tableau of an old ad where a vaguely leery man holds a drill adjacent to a shot of a bared breast. Not sure how I feel about all that, and I know I'm not a fan of the American flags, plural, flying outside (there's also what Cox described as a ""bro hang"" room downstairs, which, okay), but at least Funzi's front porch is chill, and comes complete with benches, lawn chairs, a fan, various props, and a fine view of the passing parade that is business as usual on St. Marks. Porch life at Funzi's. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""We usually have either really funky opera playing out here, or rockabilly, kind of untraditional for St. Marks,"" Cox told me as I sat munching my slices. ""Sitting out here is the most fun part of this for me, being able to interact with people. New Yorkers really don't care, they'll just come right up and be like, 'What the heck are you doing? Is this performance art?'"" Funzi's, by the way, is named after Cox's son. Funzi's Pizzeria is located at 36 St. Marks Place, between Second and Third Avenues, and is currently open daily from noon to 10 p.m. Chef Jaworski taking a moment to hang some more decor.

The Hunan Slurp Team Brings Stellar Rice Noodles to Long Island City,https://hellgatenyc.com/hunan-slurp-sofun-long-island-city,43-40 12th Street,"Sofun Kitchen (https://www.instagram.com/sofunkitchen/), Street Seats (https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/streetseats.shtml), Sofun Kitchen (https://www.instagram.com/sofunkitchen/)","43-40+12th+Street,+NYC",Sofun Kitchen,40.7504577,-73.9482385,https://www.instagram.com/sofunkitchen/,,,,"Given that the (terrific) new noodle bar Sofun Kitchen is in Long Island City, you might assume that it's hidden on one of those old-school LIC industrial wasteland blocks, or that it's in one those generic storefronts at the base of some new condo. You'd be wrong. Sofun, the sister restaurant of the acclaimed (by me and others ) Hunan Slurp in the East Village, is located on the ground floor of a two-story, terraced office park that's plopped amid the area's auto body shops, on a street that will forever be closed to through traffic thanks to an ancient glacial rock formation barricading the northern end. Thanks, ancient glacial rock formation! (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) At one point the street was used as a parking lot, but in 2019, the developer VOREA, working with the Department of Transportation, turned the block into a public pedestrian plaza , setting out seating for both passersby as well as patrons of Focal Point Brewery, Sobremesa, and now, the lucky noodle slurpers of Sofun Kitchen. Tofu and ground pork rice noodles, $18. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) I say ""lucky"" because the noodle bowls at Sofun are excellent—a riot of big flavors tangled up in slippery rice noodles, served either ""dry"" or with just enough rich and complicated broth to slurp like a hearty soup. Co-owner Chao Wang, a visual artist by training, first got into the restaurant business because he missed his grandmother's cooking back home in Hunan. Here in Long Island City, he's expanded the menu to include the traditional tastes of other Chinese regions as well, from the numbing peppercorns of Sichuan to the sour undertones in Guizhou cooking. ""LIC is getting more and more popular,"" Chao told Hell Gate. ""This is the new Chinatown. So some of the menu is the same as Hunan Slurp, but a lot is totally new. And there's dim sum. It's a restaurant for the locals here: more diverse, from different regions in China, inspired by the chefs in the kitchen and my friends."" There are about ten different noodle bowls from which to choose, and we loved both of our selections. The braised beef brisket bowl featured tons of meltingly tender meat in a bright, tangy broth of lemongrass, cilantro, star anise, peppercorns, lime, and basil—so good. Beef brisket rice noodles, $18. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) And the tofu and ground pork rice noodle bowl was maybe even better. Served without broth, this was creamy from the tofu, chewy from the ground pork, fiery with chili oil, and popping with all kinds of toppings like peanuts and pickles. Other choices include the signature Lu Fen, brought over from Hunan Slurp, which can be had with beef shank, as a vegetarian chilled rice noodle bowl, or as a soupy version starring spicy ribs. Sofun also has a half-dozen shareable appetizers, including popcorn chicken; a shiso cucumber salad; gorgeous pig trotters slathered in garlic sauce; and a deeply funky and delicious pidan, or century egg salad with grilled eggplant and peppers. Century egg salad, $14 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Garlic pig trotters, $16. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The dim sum is dope too. There are pork soup dumplings; translucent dumplings similar to har gaw; durian puff pastries; and a trio of juicy, hot, and sweet fried pumpkin balls that are astonishingly good. Beverage-wise, there are only soft drinks for now, but Chao told us that Chinese beer and cocktails are coming soon. Fried pumpkin balls, $8. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The Sofun space is a bit cramped—if you sit at the first of four tables in the tiny dining area, you'll have to get up from your seat to let people squeeze by—but it's sunny and stylish and generally a pleasant place to be. Besides, picnic possibilities abound in the Street Seats plaza, so if it's a nice evening, just go outside and eat with our friend the ancient boulder. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Sofun Kitchen is located at 43-40 12th Street in Queens, at the corner of 43rd Road, and is currently open from Tuesday through Sunday from noon to 8 p.m. (347-527-1529) Already a user?

"‘Salty Lunch Lady’ Dria Atencio Now Serving Killer Sandwiches, Cakes in Ridgewood",https://hellgatenyc.com/salty-lunch-lady-dria-atencio-killer-sandwiches-cakes-ridgewood,565 Woodward Avenue,Dria Atencio’s Food Truck (https://example.com/dria-atencio-food-truck),"565+Woodward+Avenue,+NYC",Dria Atencio’s Food Truck,40.7067463,-73.9086148,https://example.com/dria-atencio-food-truck,,,,"I first fell in love with Dria Atencio's food a couple of summers ago, when she announced via her nom de Instagram Salty Lunch Lady that she was giving away free cake scraps and frosting to anyone willing to show up at her doorstep. One DM and a quick bike ride later, and I was the proud owner of a mound of some of the best cake on the planet. Atencio's cooking background is squarely in the savory department, honed at places like the sceney Sorella (RIP) on the Lower East Side. Baking is just something she picked up during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, selling pastries on the 'gram. ""I feel like cooking is really intuitive for me, and desserts are really technical,"" she told Hell Gate. ""And I'm not a technical person. I'm like the opposite. I'm kind of like a bumbling freak."" Fortunately for us, for the past two years, Atencio has bumbled (freakily?) through the long and arduous process of opening a whole-ass restaurant, the brand new Salty Lunch Lady's Little Luncheonette in Ridgewood, a homey and welcoming neighborhood spot starring an ever-changing array of her superb baked goods and a half dozen of her equally rad sandwiches. Dill party, $15. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""Sandwiches are like the fucking perfect food,"" Atencio once told me , and though at the time she was referring to the format in general (""They're portable, they're social, everyone understands what they are, but they can also transform into so many different things""), she might as well have been talking about the hulking beauties on her Little Luncheonette menu. The ""Dill Party,"" for example, turns the tired turkey sandwich into a rowdy celebration, piling dill pickles, dill havarti, gloppy streaks of dill mayo, plus non-dill items like avocado, onto a stack of thin-sliced house-roasted bird. The strecci roll holding all of this is from Sullivan Street Bakery, and it's very good. It's maybe a bit too chewy for the task at hand, but so what, you make a little mess, you have to scoop some stuff up, it'll be fine , just enjoy life. Also delicious and messy is Atencio's spunky ""Green Eggs"" creation, a mound of creamy egg salad made with green goddess dressing and topped with watercress and, as a $4 upgrade that you should definitely say yes to, enough anchovies to seize your attention in every bite. Green eggs, $13, with anchovies, an additional $4. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The third sandwich we tried, called the ""Chicky,"" was another winner—a ""giant smashed chicken meatball"" loaded with Bulgarian feta, nearly frizzled onions, and plenty of smoky paprika mayo. There's also a tuna sandwich with ""all the herbs,"" a vegetarian ""surprise"" with roasted eggplant and whipped ricotta, and a mortadella jaw-stretcher with provolone and pickled pepper spread. Then there's dessert, which you'll be served by your friendly counterperson before you even get your sandwich, so hold back if you can. Or fuck it, eat it first, I'm not the pastry police. ""I cook grandma-style,"" said Atencio. ""You know what you're getting just by looking at it, which feels appealing in a childlike way. And it's all just very simple. Like thrown together. Like somebody actually made this for you ."" Chocolate layer cake, $10. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) No surprise, her chocolate layer cake is awesome—dense and moist to the point of gooey-ness, with lots of deep cocoa flavor. (The icing involves peanut butter.) The tangy beach pie is like a key lime but with a bit of lemon, all nestled inside a saltine crust and topped with a big creamy blob of heaven. An olive oil lemon cake and some good-looking chocolate chip cookies rounded out the sweets selection when we went on opening weekend, but just get whatever you see—the stuff sells out fast, and it's all great. The space itself is beautiful, and Atencio poured her heart into the build-out. The building is from 1915, and when she began renovating, she discovered all the tin on the walls and ceiling as well as the original wainscoting, hidden beneath drywall and a drop ceiling. Otherwise, as she told me, ""I got every single thing here secondhand."" (The tables are from Sorella, and the chairs are from ""an old lady in the middle of Pennsylvania."") ""I feel like I put maybe too much of myself into it,"" she said. ""There's also so many things that aren't up yet. There's going to be a lot of weird pictures."" Beach pie, $10. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) And despite the name, Atencio's restaurant is not really so little. There's seating for about 25 people inside, with room to spare for a fancy pantry goods area, a refrigerator case with an excellent selection of sodas and other beverages, and shelving for a bunch of top-tier chips. There are also a few additional tables and benches outside. Atencio has dinner dreams for her luncheonette as well. ""I've always wanted to do community dinners,"" she said. ""I want people to find a place where they can come and sit and laugh and spend time, and no one's ushering you out and you're sharing food together. I want to host pop-ups. I want to do collaborations. But most of all, I want to put all the tables together, have a fun tablescape and big trays of roasted chicken and salads and pastas and vegetables and like, a giant five-tier pavlova, and we can all really have fun."" Hell yeah to all of those things. Salty Lunch Lady's Little Luncheonette is located at 565 Woodward Avenue, at the corner of Menahan Street, and is currently open Thursday through Monday from noon to 4 p.m., also Atencio has regularly been selling out of stuff (she announces it on Instagram), so go early if you can.

Beloved Bayside Chef Mama Lee Brings Her Taiwanese Classics To Williamsburg,https://hellgatenyc.com/mama-lee-taiwanese-williamsburg,66 Grand Street,Mama Lee (https://www.instagram.com/mamaleesnyc/),"66+Grand+Street,+NYC",Mama Lee,40.7156185,-73.9649307,https://www.instagram.com/mamaleesnyc/,,,,"Mama Lee, née Mei Lee, joined the restaurateur class in 2013 when she opened a small, unassuming shop on a residential street in Bayside, Queens—a part of town inaccessible by subway or Citi Bike, and thus unvisited by me. Lee's second restaurant, also called Mama Lee and still in its ""soft opening"" phase, is in a more bustling location. She snagged a double-decker space in that disorienting part of Williamsburg around the luxe residences of Kent Avenue where all the landmarks, both at the retail level and, like, the actual skyline, have almost completely changed in last five years or so. It's a wild feeling to get ""lost"" on blocks you've walked down a hundred times before. Fried egg with preserved turnip, $18. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The menu here at the Willy B Mama Lee is a pared-down version of the Bayside original, but there's still about two dozen things from which to choose. Lee's famed lion's head meatball, a porcine monster that takes 24 hours to properly prepare, was not available when I went last week, so I ordered her other signature dish: the fried egg with preserved turnip, which is basically a well-done omelet with bits of root-y funk lurking within. In 2021, in the New York Times, Ligaya Mishan called the omelet one of the ""25 Essential Dishes To Eat In New York City."" While I wouldn't go that far, it is a unique, satisfying dish, especially after I dumped some vinegary hot sauce on the leftovers the next day at home. Taiwanese fried pork chop, $18 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) All four of my dishes, including that turnip omelet, were, at a minimum, a little bit sweet, and sometimes shockingly so. The fried pork chops, for example, tasted (and crunched) like they were sprinkled with sugar crystals, and the complex, sticky sauce glazing the three cup chicken registers more sweet than spicy, or salty, or garlicky, or ginger-y. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it is a thing. Three cup chicken, $20. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) My favorite item was probably the zha jiang noodles, the slippery beasts thick with black bean paste and ground pork. Zha jiang noodle, $15. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Other dishes you'll recognize on the menu include eggplant with garlic sauce, various versions of fried rice, salt and pepper shrimp, and beef noodle soup, which is pretty much the national dish of Taiwan. Maybe it wouldn't have been such a sweet feast had I ordered these last four things instead? Lee was unavailable for an interview both times I went to the shop, so I couldn't ask for her guidance, but it's certainly worth exploring. The weird new Williamsburg definitely needs as many good $20 Dinner spots as we can get. Inside Mama Lee. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The space at Mama Lee is minimally designed and divided into two sections: a loft area where you'll find most of the seating, and, at street level, the ordering counter and a couple of big group tables, at which apparently you're allowed to bring in your enormous Bernese mountain dog while you eat. The Spotify playlist is all house bangers—think Purple Disco Machine remixes—blasted at an impressively attention-getting volume. One staffer told me that this is a change from the classical music they played when it first opened, after they realized that strings were too snoozy for the neighborhood. Beverages are all nonalcoholic and include a selection of Taiwanese sodas and tea. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The Williamsburg Mama Lee is located at 66 Grand Street, between Wythe and Kent Avenues, and is currently open on Wednesday through Sunday from 12:00 noon to 10:00 p.m. Already a user?

"Your Big, Fantastic Northern Thai Spot in Bushwick Has Arrived",https://hellgatenyc.com/chiang-mai-fantastic-thai-bushwick,942 Flushing Avenue,Lamoon (https://example.com/lamoon),"942+Flushing+Avenue,+NYC",Lamoon,40.7026008,-73.933617,https://example.com/lamoon,,,,"""Where can I roll up with three or six friends at 8:00 p.m. and get seated right away for many drinks and a great dinner?"" is, to be honest, not a dilemma I'm faced with all that much anymore. Ah, lost youth! But when a legit $20 Dinner spot opens a few blocks from my apartment? And it's got lots of stuff on the menu I've never had before? Also it's a pleasant place to hang out, with good energy and, so far, plenty of space to accommodate both me (solo, or with a trusted companion) and your crew looking to eat and party? That's worth a column. Enter Chiang Mai Diner and Bar, which opened last month on the unlovely corner of Flushing and Central Avenues, with lots of plants and flowers outside and a huge menu of northern Thai specialties within. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The chef and owner is Rathakate ""Kenny"" Khuankaow, who grew up in Phayao, in northern Thailand, which he said is close to the city of Chiang Mai. This is his second restaurant; the first, Lan Larb Chiang Mai, is located in Soho, in a much smaller space, and seems to have the same menu as the new Bushwick spot. ""I came to America in 2006 but I remember when I was young I loved my grandmom's food, I loved my mom's food, I loved my dad's food,"" Khuankaow told Hell Gate. ""I would recommend people try northern Thai food. I know that not many Thai restaurants have it like this. I need to present this local food, this authentic food, my hometown food, my family's recipes, to everyone."" The menu is one of those sprawling, twelve-page jobs, complete with photographs, so I asked my server to suggest a few signature dishes. She obliged with four total bangers, all priced below twenty bucks, and all definitely entree-sized, especially when you add the little baskets of sticky rice that come with everything. Short rib hung lay, $34 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Chef Khuankaow, who entered the conversation later, insisted I also order his short rib hung lay which, at $34, was way over budget but also proved to be an exceptional mountain of meat: lovely, tender, and sticky with a ginger and garlic sauce. Worth it if you got it. Zha jein, $18 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Back in more affordable territory, the funky zha jein gets you a pile of thin-sliced flank steak, seasoned with lemon grass, mint, and saw tooth, and given considerable zing by an abundance of spicy pro larb. Use the lettuce to create little beef-and-rice wraps and feel pleased with your life choices. Knuankaow told us that in Chiang Mai, the city, the meat is usually served raw, but either way this was my favorite dish on the table. Sai oua nam prik num (fiery sausage with pounded chile), $19 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Also great was the sai oua nam prik num, a porky, fiery sausage (the sai oua, a northern Thai favorite) served with a bowl of pounded chile (the nam prik num), a mess of crackling-fried pork rinds, and a bouquet of raw vegetables. Gaeng hoh (glass noodles with pork belly and shrimp), $20 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Or get a noodle dish or two, like the superb gaeng hoh, a tangle of glass noodles strewn with pork belly, shrimp, eggplant, fermented bamboo shoot, and enough red curry paste to get your attention. Even the calmer dishes at Chiang Mai exhibit plenty of presence, like the wholly satisfying kuoy teaw kua kai, or wide noodles with chicken and squid. Kuoy teaw kua kai (wide noodles with chicken and squid) $18 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) And there's so much more to try! I'm definitely getting the boat noodles next time, which promise ""strong and very rich flavor,"" and the gaeng hung lay, a fatty pig dish that the menu claims is ""one of the most iconic of northern Thailand."" The cocktails pay homage to various aspects of the city of Chiang Mai, with drinks like the lin-ping, ""inspired by our celebrity panda,"" and the doi-chang, ""the origin of one of the best coffees in the world."" There's also mocktails, juices, and various iced coffees and teas. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Knuankaow said it only took about a month to pull the sprawling space together, which keeps the same basic layout of its former tenant, the short-lived Tiltz Sports Bar and Arcade, but looks completely different. There's a bit of neon, some traditional Thai iconography, lots of greenery, and a large back dining room decked out to feel like a field twinkling with starlight and fireflies. It's a big win for the neighborhood. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Chiang Mai Diner and Bar is located at 942 Flushing Avenue, at the corner of Central Avenue, and is currently open daily for lunch from 11:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., and for dinner from 4:30 to 10:00 (718-673-8848) Already a user?

"Wildly Delicious, Worker-Owned: Brooklyn’s New Sandwich Shop, Sea & Soil",https://hellgatenyc.com/wildly-delicious-worker-owned-brooklyns-new-sandwich-shop-sea-and-soil,102 President Street,Sea & Soil (https://example.com/sea-soil),"102+President+Street,+NYC",Sea & Soil,40.6834523,-74.0028297,https://example.com/sea-soil,,,,"Technically, Sea & Soil, a cute-looking bakery and cafe on the western edge of Carroll Gardens, doesn't open until the end of July. Peek through the bars at 102 President Street and you'll see a bright, fun paint job on the walls, a boldly tiled floor, and, as of last week, not much else. And yet, thanks to the magic of the pandemic-era pop-up, Sea & Soil is also one of my absolute favorite sandwich shops in all of New York City right now. Wild times! Sea and Soil sneak peek on Saturdays at Grand Army Plaza (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Sea & Soil is a worker-owned cooperative started by Ridgewood residents Noah Wolf and Gaby Gignoux-Wolfsohn, two educators and hospitality alumni who, during that first weird COVID summer of 2020, had a lot of time on their hands, a lot of uncertainty about their future, and Wolf's 12-year-old sourdough mother in the fridge. Sandwiches, bread, and pastries felt like the future. ""It's really hard to find a stable, well-paying, secure job,"" Gignoux-Wolfsohn told Hell Gate. ""And we really wanted to be a part of shifting the power into the hands of the workers."" A ton of experimenting, a bit of catering, and a few successful pop-ups convinced the duo that in order to live that worker-owned dream, they had to commit full time to pastry and sandwich game. And for that, they needed a storefront. ""We happened to find this space on President Street that's owned by Maragret Palca, who's been running a bakery in the neighborhood for 40 years,"" said Wolf. ""She's retiring at the end of June, and we feel honored to walk in her footsteps. She literally bequeathed us her equipment, so we'll be mixing with her mixers, and baking in her ovens. Being able to carry on that spirit in the neighborhood feels good."" Coming in late July: this colorful little worker-owned shop (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) And even though the storefront won't be open for another six weeks or so, Wolf and Gignoux-Wolfsohn are serving basically the entire Sea and Soil menu on Saturdays in Grand Army Plaza, setting up a table amid the bustle of the extremely popular greenmarket there. Most of the early morning action here at Grand Army is focused on the cold brew from Plowshares and the piles of Wolf and Gignoux-Wolfsohn's pastries—the Saturday hours, are 9:30 a.m. until sell out—and the baked goods are definitely worthy of your attention. Pastries on parade (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The croissants, both regular and vegan, are jacked to the size of hero rolls, and the pain au chocolat is equally enormous, just a ridiculously good, chewy, gooey, dessert-for-breakfast feast. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) For something less in-your-face (but still very much in the treat category) get the anko pretzel bun, a soft, salty roll stuffed generously with a sweet and sticky red bean paste. The chefs' traditional caneles, with their crisp exterior and custardy insides, are also excellent. Anko pretzel bun, $5 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) So, yes, the pastries are great, but it's the Sea & Soil sandwiches that really sent me swooning last Saturday. Both of Wolf and Gignoux-Wolfsohn's vegan creations are stellar, a funky oyster mushroom beauty called the Lena, all sloppy with pesto and chunky tomatoes, and the spicy Iz filled with curried lentils and chili crisp. The Iz: curried lentils with chili crisp, $8 to $15 sliding scale (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The meat ones also pack a punch. The River stars a killer combo of miso pork, mozzarella, and wasabi aioli, and the Wren features some grilled chicken marinated until orange in cumin and paprika. As you would expect, everything from the sauces to the sourdough rolls are made in house by the worker-owners. The River: miso pork, mozzarella, wasabi aioli, $8 to $15 sliding scale (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The Wren: grilled chicken with cumin and paprika, $8 to $15 sliding scale (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The menu will change, both at their Grand Army Saturdays stand (there's lots of seating here by the way, at tables up near the entrance to the Brooklyn Public Library and, of course, in Prospect Park), and in the storefront proper once it opens later this summer. But an integral part of Sea and Soil will always be the sliding-scale prices, which right now are $8 to $15 per sandwich, pay what you are able. ""Both of us at different points in our lives have taught food justice,"" said Wolf. ""Knowing where your food is from, how it's grown, how the earth it's grown in is taken care of, how the food workers along the entire supply chain are treated... we're trying to make all those things line up as much as possible at Sea & Soil. And we want to make our food accessible to as many people as we humanly can. We have a policy that no one is turned away for lack of funds, and everything will be on a sliding scale."" (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Sea & Soil will be at the Grand Army Plaza on Saturday mornings from now until their storefront opens (they're shooting for July 23) at 102 President Street, between Hicks and Columbia Streets.

"Tuck Into a Fiery Feast at Sunnyside’s New Hotspot, Spicy Nepal",https://hellgatenyc.com/spicy-nepal-sunnyside-review,39-35 47th Avenue,Spicy Nepal (https://www.instagram.com/spicynepal/),"39-35+47th+Avenue,+NYC",Spicy Nepal,40.7420136,-73.9252478,https://www.instagram.com/spicynepal/,,,,"When Bhawani Rai had to close Sumnima Kitchen in 2022, after six years of feeding his Woodside neighbors a wide range of Himalayan bangers, it broke his heart. ""In the pandemic time, there was so much suffering,"" Rai told Hell Gate. ""I had to leave that place."" Fortunately for Rai, and for everyone in this part of Queens who loves a big-flavored feast, the setback proved to be temporary. Late last summer, he opened Spicy Nepal on 47th Avenue in Sunnyside. ""I love cooking,"" said Rai. ""I'm happy in this business, and I fell in love with Sunnyside. Everyone is fantastic, everyone here is helping me. They taste my food and they love it."" Outside of Spicy Nepal in Sunnyside, Queens. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Just like at Sumnima Kitchen, there are some Indian offerings on the menu here in Sunnyside like vindaloo and butter chicken, as well as a few Japanese-influenced dishes like teriyaki. But for the most part, according to Rai, Spicy Nepal is more tightly focused on the dishes and flavors from his childhood home in the countryside of the Ilam district. Cross section of the complimentary vegetable samosa. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) We made quick work of the complimentary deep-fried treats that hit the table shortly after we sat down: two pakoras and a hefty vegetable samosa that came with a couple of good sauces. Also delightful was the snacky mound of wai-wai sadeko, a heavily seasoned mix of crunchy fried noodles, puffed rice, and peanuts that's apparently (and understandably) especially popular with Nepali college kids. The mixed-meat thukpa, a noodle soup with endless variations throughout the Himalayan region, was excellent here. It's a whole, hearty meal swirling in a broth that's fiery enough to get you choking if you slurp it too fast. Like most of the dishes at Spicy Nepal, the thukpa is available in a vegetarian version, as well with just chicken, or pork, or beef. Wai-wai sadeko, $6.95. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Mixed meat thukpa, $12.95. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The choila, which Rai said is traditionally made with water buffalo back in Nepal, is served here as a very charred chicken dish. The texture of this bird was unexpectedly mushy, and the flavor startlingly bitter, but once we got our bearings, and with some help from Rai's sauces, we happily wolfed it all down. Chicken choila, $13.95. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Also tasting of smoke and fire was the lamb sekuwa, chunks of fatty, skewer-roasted meat served with lots of onions and a pile of puffed rice. Sides of white rice and roti are also available for an additional two bucks, and either of those might have been the way to go with these latter two dishes. Lamb sekuwa, $15.95. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Other Nepali favorites on the menu include dhindo, which is basically a doughy blob of porridge surrounded by pickles and curries; the chewy, jerky-like sukti (which is available in water buffalo); and, of course, platters of momos in many varieties. Prime seating in Spicy Nepal's backyard. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There's no alcohol sold at Spicy Nepal, but the party of dudes eating and hanging near us brought in a couple of six packs of Heineken, and maybe you could too? Or just stick with chai, mango lassi, butter tea, or a can of Red Bull, all of which can and should be consumed in the restaurant's exceptionally pleasant back yard. Spicy Nepal is located at 39-35 47th Avenue, between 39th and 40th Streets, and is currently open from 11:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. daily. (917-745-0044) Already a user? Log in Thanks for reading!

Wegmaniacs Beware: The Prepared Food at the New Astor Place Wegmans Is Awful,https://hellgatenyc.com/wegmans-astor-place-prepared-food-awful,770 Broadway,Wegmaniacs (https://example.com/wegmaniacs),"770+Broadway,+NYC",Wegmaniacs,40.7306938,-73.9915383,https://example.com/wegmaniacs,,,,"On Wednesday morning, East New York resident Jordan White woke up hours before dawn to make his way to Astor Place and get on line to do some grocery shopping. When I met him, he had been waiting since 4 a.m. to get into the brand-new 87,500-square feet Wegmans supermarket, which now fills the two-story space where Kmart used to be. ""It's a momentous occasion,"" White told Hell Gate. ""I love seeing everyone excited for the new store, seeing everything as fresh as can be, even though Wegmans is very big on quality so everything every day is fresh. I'm from Rochester, moved here in 2016, and there weren't a lot of options that I felt like I could go to and get pretty much everything I wanted in one place. Not like Wegmans."" If this sort of passion for a grocery store chain is surprising to you, then you've obviously never spoken with a Wegmans true believer. A Wegmaniac, if you will. Wegmaniacs on line about an hour before doors on opening day. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Wegmaniacs tend to talk that way about this place, as if they're parroting ad copy. Take Bradley Orego, who drove from Buffalo to throw an opening day tailgate party on the sidewalk with his buddy, Bushwick resident Jeff Pollock, giving out plates of pancakes to passersby. ""Wegmans has been such an important part of my life. I grew up with Wegmans,"" Orego explained. ""Any time I'm not in a city that has a Wegmans, I'm like, you don't know what you're missing, it's a different experience. What I tell folks is that the quality of the goods is so high, but the prices are not, and that's what makes Wegmans special."" (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The family-owned supermarket chain started in Rochester in 1916, and today, there are more than 110 stores along the East Coast. New York City got its first Wegmans in 2019 at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and opening day there was a chaotic scene . Politicians were on hand for a ribbon cutting, hundreds of people waited for hours in the pouring rain on Flushing Avenue to get inside, and the 700-car parking lot was filled to capacity. But for most of us, the Navy Yard is a pretty useless location for a grocery store, catering more to car owners and drivers than subway and bus riders, cyclists, and pedestrians. Astor Place, on the other hand, is a core New York City location, with multiple subway lines within easy walking distance, the iconic Cube across the street, and loads of late-night memories lurking for anyone who's lived here for more than a minute or two. And the building itself, which once housed an annex to the original Wanamaker's department store, is an official City landmark. I spent nearly three hours at the Astor Place Wegmans on opening day. Beginning with the good news first, the enormous lower level is stocked with everything you could hope to find in a supermarket, from good junky snacks and soda to paper goods and drugstore stuff to mountains of produce and multiple shelves of kombucha. Most exciting for me, the ice cream selection is solid as hell, highlighted by pints of Graeter's, the great Cincinnati brand that's hard to find in New York City. Just a few of your options at the fish counter downstairs. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There's a huge butcher section, with lots of cheese sporting corny names like We Be Chivin' and Sake2Me, and a deli with plastic packages of pre-sliced meats. Most interesting (and, these days, pretty unique in the city) is the somewhat pretentiously named Sakanaya (Japanese for ""fish counter""), which features an almost comically large and diverse selection of whole fish. You can get any of these cleaned and filleted on the spot, and one of the mongers will walk you through the best ways to cook it. Almost nothing down here seemed either outrageously overpriced or blessedly cheap, though there are some super luxe items thrown in for the NoHo crowd, like the $72 one-pound whole thornyhead fish flown in from Japan, and the $240 per pound snow-aged A5 Wagyu strip. Really, it's on the store's main floor, home to Wegmans's vaunted selection of hot dishes, sushi, and prepared meals, that the whole ""land of plenty"" promise falls apart. It's where Wegmans's vast quantities and gleaming surfaces and super-friendly service can't hide the fact that the food up here just isn't any good. The worst slice of pizza I had all year, $4. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The pizza, for example, which comes in a half-dozen varieties and is made on the spot, is awful. It probably doesn't help that there are decent slice shops galore in this part of town, including the excellent Funzi's a block away, but still, you can't land in the East Village slinging this sort of bland, gluey nonsense and expect to get away with it. Maybe they should hire some local talent to run this department? There's a hot sandwich stand, with offerings like chicken shawarma, pastrami, Kobe beef, and a really sad excuse for a Cuban, which is dominated by thick slices of cold boiled ham. As for the other items I tried, I figured I was playing it safe with the Buffalo chicken soup—I mean come, this is a Western New York outfit, no?—but somehow, it tasted mostly of carrots. The slightly spicy Buffalo wings were a little better. The sweet barbecue wings were a little worse. Tuna volcano roll, a total gloppy disaster, $11.99. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Please take my advice: Don't get the tuna volcano roll. I probably don't need to tell you that—sushi drenched in various mayos is never a good idea—but just in case you get struck by a fit of ""when in Rome"" recklessness like I did, know that it's a gloppy, unfinishable disaster. And was the best thing I ate all afternoon a pair of mediocre mall-ish cookies? Maybe. They certainly were very sugary. Another cause for discouragement—unlike the Navy Yard Wegmans, which offers cafe-style seating for 140 people both indoors and out, there's nowhere to eat on the premises. Yes, a sushi bar and a ""champagne and oyster"" restaurant are coming next year, in the currently walled-off space just to the left of the entrance, but all of us soup-and-sandwich peasants will still have to leave the store and grab a table (or a rock) across Lafayette at the Astor Place plaza. Admittedly, the fact that a supermarket's prepared food is boring or bad isn't exactly breaking news. But since Wegmans highlights that part of their operation—most of the main floor is turned over to all the various grab-n-go stations—it seems worthwhile to suggest that, upon entering, you head straight downstairs and get your grocery shopping done. Half a sad Cuban, $8; timid Buffalo chicken soup, $5.99. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Or just wander around a bit and vibe out! As NYU student Charlotte Wyman told me on her way home, arms laden with Wegmans jelly beans, chocolate chips, and baby carrots, ""It was so entertaining, so much fun in there. I had a great time. I love grocery stores in general, so it was really an exciting experience. It felt like Disney World.""

Feast on Phenomenal Filipino Food at Patok by Rach in Inwood,https://hellgatenyc.com/patok-by-rach-in-inwood-review,5057 Broadway,Patok by Rach (https://hellgatenyc.com/patok-by-rach-in-inwood),"5057+Broadway,+NYC",Patok by Rach,40.8705144657982,-73.9156902391263,https://hellgatenyc.com/patok-by-rach-in-inwood,,,,"The first time Rachel Saberon fed me her lechon, we were standing under the arches of Harlem, along with thousands of other hungry people, in the spring of 2022. That's when she and her business partner Hannah Abada made their debut as Patok by Rach at the Uptown Night Market. The Filipino roasted pig they served that evening was incredible, so fatty and funky, so sticky and sweet. Patok basically means ""a hit"" in English, and this pig definitely was that. Dunking that pork belly into a vat of bubbling oil for the chicharron. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) A month later we met again in the Bronx at Fordham Plaza, and a month after that I wolfed down her pork belly at Industry City in Brooklyn. Just a legendary run of lechon! But as fun and cool as it is to eat this stuff at seasonal outdoor markets, I thought: Wouldn't it be great if we could just get Saberon and Abada's roasted pork every day if we wanted? Like at an actual restaurant? And maybe other Filipino delights like lumpia and chicharron too? Lechon kawali, or chicharron, $18.99. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) If you live up in Inwood, or don't mind hopping on the A to the end of line for a delicious piggy feast, then that dream just became a reality—Patok by Rach, the brick and mortar restaurant, is now up and running seven days a week on upper Broadway. Sample of marinated and grilled chicken inasal. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""This was a long-time prayer,"" Saberon told Hell Gate. ""I lived here two years ago and there just wasn't enough Asian food around. I believe we're the first Filipino restaurant in the area, which I think is bizarre. Filipino and Latin food are very similar, so I thought it was a no-brainer. This is a neighborhood where people really appreciate their pork."" Inside Patok by Rach. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Saberon was born and raised in Cagayan de Oro, in Mindanao in the Philippines. But her lechon recipe, she told us, ""came from my father who grew up in Cebu City."" It's a fantastic plate of pig, with crackling skin and big hunks of soft, juicy meat, served with a mound of rice and three crocks of sauce—one dark and vinegary, one a cucumber salad that's basically little chunks of pickles, and a third filled with a rich and sludgy liver-based condiment called Mang Tomas, or ""Filipino gravy,"" as Saberon put it. Sample of the lechon belly. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The regular lechon is actually slightly over our official $20 Dinner budget (it's $22.95), but Patok's lechon kawali platter, in which slabs of pork belly are deep fried like chicharron, is $18.99 and just as delicious—albeit slightly more perilous if your teeth are prone to cracking. I love both of those dishes at Patok, and would happily eat either of them at least once a week if I lived up in Inwood—but I think Patok's pork sisig may be even better. This is the best version of the Filipino classic that I've ever had. The pig is diced, seasoned, and fired under high heat to a tender, chewy, intensely pleasurable finish, and the slivers of jalapeños scattered on top are a nice touch. Pork sisig, $18.99. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Other fire-roasted fare includes some good-looking pork skewers and a remarkably smoky piece of roast chicken. And it's not all meat, either. The Patok's pork lumpia is excellent, boasting an impressive amount of flavor for such a skinny package, but the veggie version is almost as good. There's also liang, made from dried taro leaves and coconut milk, and a tofu and mushroom dish. Sadly, the freezer was on the fritz last week, so I couldn't try Patok's ice cream-topped halo-halo for dessert. Next time. Veggie lumpia, $10. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) For the Patok team, who are used to churning out lechon in festival tents and compact commissary kitchens, the space itself here in Inwood is luxuriously expansive. But the first thing you'll think is: holy shit there's a tree in here!

Bed-Stuy’s Stellar New Bakery Bread and Butter Is Stuffed With Savory and Sweet Delights,https://hellgatenyc.com/bakery-bread-and-butter-bed-stuy-review,53 Rockaway Avenue,Bread and Butter (https://example.com/bread-butter),"53+Rockaway+Avenue,+NYC",Bread and Butter,40.6813472,-73.9112416,https://example.com/bread-butter,,,,"In March of 2020, chefs Autumn Moultrie and Brian Villanueva had no dreams of owning their own bakery. Villanueva was working in the kitchen at Blue Hill at Stone Barns, and Moultrie, who moved here from Las Vegas to help open The Grill, had a job at the restaurant and hospitality behemoth Major Food Group and did food styling on the side. The couple lived in Ditmas Park, and the trajectory of their lives seemed clear. COVID, of course, upended all that. When the pandemic hit, both found themselves out of a job, with plenty of time on their hands and, fortuitously, a sourdough starter in their fridge. ""We were regular savory chefs,"" Moultrie told Hell Gate. ""But we just started baking, baking, baking, trying stuff out, and in the building that we were living in, there were a lot of elderly individuals, so Brian started gifting everyone loaves of sourdough."" Word of their baked goods got out through a Facebook group. Soon, the couple ramped up production; Moultrie added her pillowy, beignet-like ""angel doughnuts"" to the mix; and Back Alley Bread was born. Initially, it was an Instagram-driven, delivery-only service, but it eventually morphed into a pop-up in places like Purple Yam and Mallard Drake. ""We always had an issue finding a kitchen we could afford,"" said Moultrie. ""It wasn't like we had saved up money to open up some grand bakery, so we just started bugging random friends to use their bars and restaurants. But there came a point when it was like, maybe we should consider getting more serious about this."" Now, we have the newly renamed Bread and Butter, an actual, physical bakery in the Ocean Hill part of Bed-Stuy which boasts an impressive array of the couple's sweet and savory delights. Walk-ins are welcome, and there's a full coffee menu and some seating, but until Villanueva and Moultrie are able to staff up the kitchen to meet demand, pre-ordering for pickup via their website is the way to go if you want to make sure you can choose from the full menu. Frito pie, $16. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The Frito pie, for example, makes for a phenomenal comfort food meal. Shaped like a classic pot pie and starring a flaky crust that's actually made from Fritos, this hefty beast is filled with a zingy beef chili and melted cheddar cheese. There's also a chicken and biscuit pot pie, and a vegetarian mushroom and herb version. The generously topped focaccia is equally hearty and delicious, whether sold by the slice from the case (there were some French onion slabs, gooey with gruyere and gouda, still available when I was there on a recent Sunday around noon) or as a whole 14-inch by 7-inch ""pie."" I got the superb spicy tomato salami focaccia in the latter size, and I'm still happily reheating slices in the air fryer at home. Spicy tomato salami focaccia, $18. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) For a snackier savory treat, both of Bread and Butter's curry-crusted hand pies, either the beef and cheese or the cauliflower and mushroom, really hit the spot. Beef and cheese hand pie and and cauliflower and mushroom hand pie, $7 each. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The sweets here are also excellent all around. There's a textbook brown butter chocolate chip cookie, a chewy pecan bar, a brioche-y honey bun, and a heavenly apple cider caramel yeast doughnut that's guaranteed to make a mess of your face. But for a real, fancy-ish dessert dessert, order a slice of the incredibly good, improbably fluffy coconut and ube cheesecake. The duo really flex their fine-dining chops with this beauty. Honey bun, $5. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""Our menu's kind of funky,"" said Moultrie. ""We're not your typical bakery. It's definitely a nostalgic love letter to our childhood, mixed in with our restaurant experience. We just try to make good food, and make people happy."" The apple cider caramel donut ($4.50), pecan bar ($5), and coconut ube cheesecake ($7.75). (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) In addition to expanding Bread and Butter's days and hours going forward, Villanueva and Moultrie, who now live in Bed-Stuy, hope to serve their new neighborhood in ways beyond simply selling pretty doughnuts and delicious loaves of bread. Hosting free baking classes is one of their ideas; stocking a grab-n-go case with salads and such, given away to people experiencing food insecurity, is another. ""I just think it's really important to be a good neighbor. We're working on all of that programming because we don't want to just be an Instagram-famous bakery, or strive to be viral, and have a huge line out front,"" said Moultrie. ""We want to really be part of the community."" (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Bread and Butter is located at 53 Rockaway Avenue, between Marion and Sumpter Streets, and is currently open for walk-ins and pick-ups on Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday from 9 a.m. until it’s sold out. For the best selection, pre-order online . (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Already a user? Log in Thanks for reading!

Cloud Offers Up Reliable Vietnamese Comfort Food in the LES,https://hellgatenyc.com/cloud-vietnamese-lower-east-side-clinton-street,79 Clinton Street,Cloud Vietnamese Comfort Food (https://example.com/cloud-vietnamese-comfort),"79+Clinton+Street,+NYC",Cloud Vietnamese Comfort Food,40.7189233449358,-73.9852736633213,https://example.com/cloud-vietnamese-comfort,,,,"The story behind Cloud, a Vietnamese restaurant that opened about a month ago on the Lower East Side, began in the 1960s in a northeastern province of Thailand called Nakhon Phanom, according to co-owner Chan Maneesilasan. Maneesilasan's family is originally from that province, which is near the border of Vietnam, he told Hell Gate. ""And many decades ago, Vietnamese refugees came to settle there, and became friends with our grandmas, and they all exchanged recipes,"" Maneesilasan explained. ""With Cloud, I want to honor these grandmas, honor the friendship they all shared and the passion for food between cultures."" Not that Cloud is some sort of experimental Thai-Viet fusion restaurant—the menu here mostly plays it safe, dominated as it is by familiar Vietnamese fare. But cold weather is coming, when sometimes all you want is a big bowl of warm noodles, and Cloud definitely delivers on the comfort food front. There's some good pho to be had, a big bowl of restorative gingery broth swimming with slippery rice noodles and several types of beef: thin-sliced eye round, fatty tendon, fun little meatballs. Other noodle-based dishes include bahn cahn, which is heavy on the pork, and the stir-fried pho xao. Pho, $17. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The fried appetizer selection also covers well-trodden ground, with items like chicken wings and ribs (both are served with honey fish sauce), as well as calamari. One slightly more offbeat offering here is Cloud's version of cha gio, which finds the crispy spring rolls stuffed with both ground pork and a whole shrimp, as well as jicama and mushrooms. Cha gio stuffed with ground pork, shrimp, and mushroom, $14. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Another snacky, satisfying option are the mackerel rolls, which sub out the more common shrimp for filets of the oily fish, stuffed in there with the usual rice vermicelli and crunchy vegetables. Served chilled, they're especially good when dunked in the accompanying peanut sauce, and less good when dipped in the also-accompanying ""tangy mayo."" Mackerel rolls, $14. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The com suon nuong, or grilled pork chop, was less fatty and juicy than I usually like in my pig, though when plopped atop a mound of rice and drenched in fish sauce, it made for a satisfying meal. A runny fried egg also helped. Com suon nuong, $20. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There's no beer or liquor available yet, which is a tough way to run a restaurant in this part of town, but Maneesilasan is hopeful that the liquor license gods will smile upon him soon. In the meantime, you can get an avocado smoothie or a peanut butter-infused coffee and bop along to quirky covers of pop-radio songs beneath the impressively expansive and goofily lit cotton-puff cloud hovering over the main dining room. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""We had been looking for a location for months,"" Maneesilasan said. ""And the first moment we walked in here, we were like, oh, this is the place. We are immigrants, and travel around the world like clouds. We're excited to be here and get to know this neighborhood."" Cloud is located at 79 Clinton Street, between Delancey and Rivington Streets, and is currently open from noon to 10 p.m. daily (646-398-9911) . (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Already a user?

Miami’s El Primo Brings Top-Notch Birria Delights to Avenue A,https://hellgatenyc.com/el-primo-brings-top-notch-birria-delights-tacos-nyc,151 Avenue A,El Primo (https://hellgatenyc.com/el-primo-brings-top-notch-birria-delights-to-miami),"151+Avenue+A,+NYC",El Primo,40.7278519754624,-73.9826895213889,https://hellgatenyc.com/el-primo-brings-top-notch-birria-delights-to-miami,,,,"Is it exciting that a birria spot just opened in the East Village? I mean, come on, is this 2019? Back then, four long years ago, most of the city had no immediate access to this rich, wet beef stew (there are goat versions as well) that is, among other things, a Tijuana taco staple. Birria, and specifically the Tijuana-style birria taco, was largely unknown around these parts until Pete Wells blew it up with a big review in the New York Times of the Birria-Landia truck in Jackson Heights. Whoaaaa , said everyone, and multiple birria trucks, restaurants, and semi-secret spots soon followed. Most every taco shop in town proceeded to add birria to their menu , until this once-rare beast became almost as ubiquitous as the dollar slice, especially in party zones like Jefftown and Hell Square . So, no, the mere fact that a place is selling birria in the East Village in the fall of 2023 isn't really news. But—and this is a big ""but""—the spanking-new El Primo, which opened two weeks ago across from Tompkins Square Park, does birria so well, and in so many appealing guises, that not only does it deserve to become a neighborhood go-to, but all taco fans in our city should make a trip just to check it out. ""I think there aren't any, like, 100 percent authentic Tijuana birria tacos in New York City,"" El Primo's manager Miguel Hernandez told Hell Gate. ""So that's why we are here. Honestly, this birria experience is 100 percent Tijuana-style."" Those are probably fighting words for some, but Hernandez spent most of his life in Tijuana, and he's been eating this stuff since he was a little kid, back when his mom would take him to get birria for breakfast. ""The first time I took a bite of an El Primo taco, I was like, wow,"" he said. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) That first bite happened in Miami, where there are two El Primos, the first of which began as a pop-up at a Baja-style restaurant called PEZ, where Hernandez worked as a sous chef. Like any sane person, Hernandez recently fled Florida for NYC—""I don't like Miami. I prefer the city. I like to ride a bike,"" he told me—and so was tapped by the El Primo team to run this spot on Avenue A. The birria tacos, or ""red tacos"" as the Insta-friendly signage here screams, form the core of the menu, and the two I ate were superb. Get the chewy quesataco if you like fat-fried corn tortillas and a ton of gooey cheese with your stew; the ""taco perron"" features a flour tortilla, also dunked in the birria juice before grilling, and is laden with meat, some good guacamole, and a bunch of whole red beans. Both of these beasts are a mess, and both are delicious. Birria smashburger with fries, $12. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Other taco options are further variations on the above. The vampiro is extra crunchy. The huesitaco co-stars bone marrow. The quesabirria is more like a quesadilla. A cup of consommé, for dipping or sipping between bites, costs $2 extra, and is well worth getting if you're feeling flush. Other ways to get your birria fix at El Primo include birria ramen; birria nachos (by far the most shareable dish); and a terrific birria smashburger, the charred patty sticking out on all sides from its potato bun, and topped with some sloppy stew, pickles, and a pink sauce. A tip: You should absolutely dunk this beauty into consommé if you have some at the table. Birria nachos, $16. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The birria burger also comes with a generous side of fries, and you know how sometimes you get fries at a random place that you wouldn't think really cared about their fries, but then it turns out the fries are freakin' awesome? That's El Primo. These are some serious Top 10-list fries. You can get booze with your tacos, either one of several beers or a 12-ounce, $5 margarita. There's housemade horchata and a nice hibiscus agua fresca as well, the latter of which really hit the spot after all that meat, fat, and salt. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) El Primo is located at 151 Avenue A, between East Ninth and East 10th Streets, and is currently open on Sunday through Wednesday from noon to 11 p.m., and on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from noon to 1 a.m. You can expect to see Hernadez at the counter, unless he's out training for the marathon—this year's race will be his third in NYC.

Elmhurst’s Taste of Himalaya Is Absolutely Delicious,https://hellgatenyc.com/taste-of-himalaya-elmhurst-queens-so-good,75-16 Broadway,Taste of Himalaya (https://example.com/taste-himalaya),"75-16+Broadway,+NYC",Taste of Himalaya,40.7458825,-73.8900237,https://example.com/taste-himalaya,,,,"Tsering Yamzzom started out in the babysitting business when she first arrived in New York City from her native Nepal about seven years ago. It was fine, she said, but then two close friends from back home—Thenleg Chaodan, who grew up in Tibet, and Tsering Lhagyal, whose family is Indo-Chinese—joined her in the city. The three became roommates in Jackson Heights, cooking for each other at night, and eventually, they concocted a scheme to open a restaurant together. ""Back home in Nepali India, my parents had a tiny restaurant,"" Yamzzom told Hell Gate. ""So I grew up watching them cook, and now I love to cook. And I really love to eat."" Me too. Which is why I'm delighted to tell you now that not only is the trio's restaurant Taste of Himalaya a really fun idea—each of the three chef-owners handles their own regional specialties—but most important, the food is absolutely delicious. Bring a crew, because Taste of Himalaya is the sort of place where you can order a bunch of stuff from all over the menu and still come in at about the $20 per person mark, though you'll be tempted to go over and bring home leftovers. Everything I ate here on one of our many recent subtropical evenings was excellent—nothing hits the table flat; it all sings—but my favorite dishes were probably the most offal-y. The gyuma, a Tibetan sausage made from yak or sheep's blood, according to the menu, was superb, the mineral funk balanced nicely by roasted sweet onions and peppers. Gyuma, a sausage made with yak or sheep's blood, $12.99. (Scott Lynch) And the Nepali goat bhuttan was even better, arriving as a pile of chopped-up goat tripe and ""other digestive parts,"" including small squares of some lovely liver, well-seasoned and stir-fried with a lot of garlic. As Caroline Shin noted in Eater , one of Taste of Himalaya's most popular items is their okra pepper salt dish, and understandably so. The okra has a slightly crisp shell but is sautéed to a pleasant softness inside, and there's enough chili oil for the dish to qualify as fiery. Also quite spicy are the wedges of chili potatoes, described as Indian-Chinese and drizzled with honey. Okra pepper salt, $9.99. (Scott Lynch) There are momos, of course, in a half-dozen or so varieties, and they are plump and dense with a thicker skin than most. I got the ones stuffed with alu cheese, which is sometimes called potato cheese, and they really hit the spot. These are served with a crock of terrific housemade chutney, and you should dump that stuff on with abandon. Alu cheese momo, $8.99. (Scott Lynch) For a festive, shareable centerpiece for your table, get one of the thali platters, which in my case came with sukuti, or air-dried beef, in a tomato-based sauce, as well as some good dal, a mound of rice, and a bunch of different pickled vegetables and chutneys, a few of which were startlingly bitter. There's so much more, too—several versions of the Tibetan noodle soup thukpa, Nepali standouts like chatbat (puffed rice, dried instant noodles, chickpeas); and loads more Indo-Chinese dishes, such as hakka noodles and sweet corn soup with chicken. Crispy chili potato, $9.99. (Scott Lynch) Note that your server brings over a trio of sauces in some handsome blue pots when you first sit down, and all three, but especially the zingy chutney, are worth exploring. For beverages, there are sodas, mango lassi, chai, and a lovely cup of Tibetan butter tea. Taste of Himalaya is located on a somewhat grim stretch of Broadway in Elmhurst, about a block away from the Jackson Heights-Roosevelt Avenue subway station and the adjacent bus terminal. So it's convenient to get to, which is awesome, but it's also an area that people typically hurry through to get to somewhere else, rather than stroll around looking for a place to eat. Don't let that dissuade you! Once you pass through Taste of Himayala's auto parts supplier-looking exterior, it's remarkably chill and comfortable inside. The team spent six months transforming the space, so settle into your high-back chair, enjoy a moment of serenity (really, I can't believe how quiet it is in here, given the honking hordes right outside on Broadway), gaze at the big screen playing a slideshow of generic nature vistas, and get ready for a feast, because feast you shall. (Scott Lynch) Taste of Himalaya is located at 75-16 Broadway, between 75th and 76th Streets in Elmhurst, Queens, and is currently open on Sunday and Tuesday through Thursday from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., and on Friday and Saturday from 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. (Scott Lynch) Already a user?

Decadent Smorgasburg Favorite Duck Season Opens in NYU Territory,https://hellgatenyc.com/smorgasburg-favorite-duck-season-review,289 Mercer Street,Duck Season (https://www.instagram.com/duckseasonnyc/?hl=en),"289+Mercer+Street,+NYC",Duck Season,40.7302341,-73.9940323,https://www.instagram.com/duckseasonnyc/?hl=en,,,,"Sometimes, you want something light and refreshing, like a salad. Nothing wrong with that. I love a good salad. Other times, though? Maybe late at night, or after a long day of getting high in Washington Square Park? You need a mountain of duck fat fries, smothered in duck gravy, with globs of cheese curds melting throughout and tons of rich duck confit piled on top. For the former...I don't know, go to a Chop’t or whatever. For the latter, and for other deeply satisfying fare like sloppy burgers and funky wings, the absolute move is the new Duck Season, which chef Josh Applebaum opened in August just off of East 8th Street in the neighborhood that can perhaps best be described as ""NYU."" Smorgasburg fans may already know Applebaum; Duck Season has been a staple at the popular weekly food market since 2015, and these days he (and his duck) can be found at all three Smorg locations: Fridays at the World Trade Center, Saturday in Williamsburg, Sunday in Prospect Park. Outside of Duck Season. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""I grew up working in my dad's delis in New Jersey, straight through grad school,"" Applebaum told Hell Gate. ""I have a masters in public policy, did an office job for several years, and got fed up with it. The company got consolidated, bought out so many times...you just hit a wall at a certain point."" In 2014, Applebaum began his escape plan with what he called a ""side hustle gig"" at Smorg favorite Bon Chovie, the late, great, rock-n-roll fried anchovy booth. After scoping out the scene, he launched Duck Season the following year. ""My grandmother's roast duck was always the pièce de résistance at any Rosh Hashanah table,"" he said. ""But when I was in college, I studied in France and discovered duck confit. It was like, oh , you don't have to do the whole duck. You can just do the leg."" Duck wings in a sticky, spicy fish sauce, $18 for four. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) That first season Duck Season started as a legs-only affair, but Applebaum quickly realized the restaurant was stacking up on duck fat, fast. ""Ducks just generate a tremendous amount of fat, and we had to do something with it all—it's the best cooking fat, bar none, you'll ever encounter in your entire life,"" he said. ""That's how we got the duck fat fries, and that really made Duck Season take off."" Rightly so. Applebaum's fries are awesome examples of that earthy, mostly soft (there's a bit of crunch to some), hand-cut category, which hold up well when given the poutine treatment: duck gravy, cheese curds, plus duck bacon or shredded duck confit if you choose. Ketchup might seem beside the point when faced with this beast, but I found that it brings a nice little hit of acid to the party. Duck fat cheeseburger with duck bacon and duck fat fries, $20. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The burgers are monsters as well, whether you get just a straight up cheeseburger (grilled in duck fat, naturally) or add slabs of that duck bacon, or duck confit, on top. Do you need a side of fries with these? Not necessarily—it's a large, rich sandwich to be sure—but also, hell yeah you do. Soon, chef Applebaum will serve duck breast like this, likely with fries. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Applebaum also offers his duck wings on most days as a special, the bird confited and smoked and covered in a sticky, spicy lime fish sauce. These are great, as is the fancy duck breast in a fresh blackberry sauce that he sneak-previewed for me, and which he hopes to add to the Duck Season menu in the fall. He also promises ""snazzier signage"" soon. Seating, though, will remain just the eight or so stools looking out onto Mercer Street, and he will continue to share the space with a bubble tea outfit called Tora Tea. The new Duck Season shares its Mercer Street space with Tora Tea. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""Our ethos has always been to make as much as we can from scratch,"" said Applebaum. ""We still hand cut all of our own french fries, we're still rendering all of our own duck fat, and we work with one single farm upstate, La Belle Farm, who supplies all of our ducks. So people who are choosing between us and a chain restaurant, know that here you're supporting New York farmers exclusively."" Duck Season is located at 289 Mercer Street, between East 8th Street and Waverly Place, and is currently open on Tuesday through Thursday from 4:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., on Friday and Saturday from 4:00 p.m. to midnight, and on Sunday from 4:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Already a user?

Super Taste’s Legendary Noodles Breathe Life Into the Upper East Side,https://hellgatenyc.com/super-taste-upper-east-side,1502 First Avenue,Super Taste (https://example.com/super-taste),"1502+First+Avenue,+NYC",Super Taste,40.7718429,-73.9527208,https://example.com/super-taste,,,,"Qixiang Yan, who also goes by Steven Yan, had no intention of creating a family hand-pulled-noodle empire when he first opened Super Taste on Eldridge Street in 2004, a few months before his son Johnson was born. ""My sister and I have always wanted to expand Super Taste, but we were constantly discouraged by our parents,"" Johnson told Hell Gate last week. ""Like, they never really wanted us to pursue the restaurant industry. They told me three years ago that they were planning to close Super Taste down once I graduated college, and I just didn't want that to happen."" And so Johnson (""As in the president Lyndon B. Johnson,"" he deadpanned) learned the business, first managing the Eldridge Street original and then, earlier this month, opening a spanking new Super Taste on the Upper East Side. ""I think my father's food is some of the best in the world, and everybody should be able to have a taste of it,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep that legacy alive."" Located amid the retail clutter of First Avenue up here in the 70s and 80s— so many mediocre restaurants and depressing bars in this part of town—Super Taste brings some of that Chinatown vitality to what can be a pretty dreary dining landscape. ""When I was up here building the interior from scratch I would order some of the Chinese food available in the neighborhood, and I was not impressed,"" Johnson recalled. ""I was like, they need something better. And that's what I'm here for."" Hot and spicy beef noodles, $13.50 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The UES menu is a slightly abbreviated version of the downtown original, and most everything's a dollar or three more expensive. But the first thing to get at Super Taste remains the same: hot and spicy beef noodle soup. The meat is shockingly tender but still fatty and full of flavor, the hand-pulled noodles are wonderfully chewy, the bok choy adds brightness and crunch, and the broth is rich as hell with some serious zing to it. Just a lovely rendition of the classic dish. There are a half dozen other soup noodle dishes as well. Pork belly and pickled bamboo are the headliners in one; a couple of others—the fiery ""Mount Qi"" collection—co-star green peas, red pepper, corn, and black fungus. Hot sesame noodles, $10.95 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) If you're in the mood for something less splashy (yes, as always, I stained my shirt eating the above) you can also get no-broth dishes like dan-dan noodles with either beef or pork, or the vegetarian shallot oil noodles with cucumber and fried tofu, or Super Taste's very good hot sesame noodles, which combines that thick, nutty paste with ground pork and pickled cabbage. Stewed pork burger, $5.95 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The snacky stewed pork burger is also a winner—the sesame bun has just the right amount of springiness to it—and the sticky baos, filled with slabs of pork and peanut powder, also do the trick. Steamed pork and chive dumplings, $7.95 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The best, most easily shareable dish among the appetizers is the heaping platter of old-school pork and chive dumplings, which you can get steamed (my preference, especially when slathered with chili oil) or fried. There are vegetarian shiitake dumplings also available. The space is utilitarian—you could call it ""clean and sleek"" or ""un-decorated,"" depending on your preference for such things, with seating at four four-tops. You can order via touch-screen at the kiosk or via human at the counter. Either way, Johnson Yan is stoked to serve you. ""Super Taste is on the cusp of having legendary status in the city,"" he proclaimed. ""We're not quite there yet, but I do think this is some of the best Chinese food in the world."" (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The new UES Super Taste is located at 1502 First Avenue, between 78th and 79th Streets, and is currently open from 10:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. daily (646-388-2999) Already a user?

Tacombi CDMX Vs. Yellow Rose: A Taco Showdown in the East Village,https://hellgatenyc.com/tacombi-yellow-rose-taco-showdown-east-village-nyc,139 East 12th Street,Tacombi (),"139+East+12th+Street,+NYC",Tacombi,40.7321753,-73.9883101,https://www.yellowrosenyc.com/,,,,"""There are no good tacos in New York City "" has likely come out of the mouth of the laziest, most cliché-spouting and incorrect person in your life. Sure, there are plenty of bad tacos to be found in this town. But there are also a ton of terrible burgers out there, and innumerable sad, soggy slices of pizza. It's a big place, this city of ours, full of wonders and horrors in equal measure. One of the most consistently magical taco spots in NYC, which the semi-imaginary dude quoted above has clearly never been to, is Yellow Rose in the East Village, a restaurant whose ramshackle charms prove to be the perfect setting for some truly excellent rustic-ish Texan food. And then, about a month ago, the big-money-backed chain Tacombi opened a slick, CDMX-esque taqueria right down the block from Yellow Rose. Naturally, it's time for a taco showdown on Third Avenue. (And, yes, I know there's also that Taco Bell that opened last year right next door to Yellow Rose, but that shit is straight trash, sorry.) The Contender Earlier this summer in mid-July, a Tacombi opened up shop on East 12th Street, right off Third Avenue. This isn't really so newsworthy in and of itself. Ever since it got $27.5 million from Danny Meyer's investment group in 2021, the once-charming taco spot in Nolita has been on an expansion tear—except that here in the East Village, they're trying something new. Instead of Tacombi's usual Baja crispy fish, beef birria, and carnitas crowd-pleasers, this outpost is going full Mexico City, with a tight menu of CDMX street-vendor classics. First and foremost, there's the suadero taco, made from a cut of cow that Pete Wells wrote is sometimes called the fly shaker , because it's the muscle the animals use to twitch their flanks and, hopefully, discourage biting insects from settling in for supper. The choricero at the new Tacombi, in which they cook the suadero and the longaniza. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) As popular as suadero is in Mexico City and in much of Latin America, it is much less commonly used in New York City (the obvious exception being the brilliant Taqueria Ramírez in Greenpoint), and so it's a good thing that a place as financially juiced as Tacombi is bringing it to the forefront of this new venture. Tacombi's al pastor taco, $4.98; suadero taco, $5.49; and longaniza taco, $4.98. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Unfortunately, the suadero here isn't very good. Or I should say, it's as uninspired and unexciting as everything else coming from any of the Tacombi kitchens these days. The al pastor is also pretty lifeless—it was early in the evening when I visited, and already the trompo felt a little tired—but the longaniza taco had some spark to it, the sausage emerging with plenty of fire and flair from the burbling choricero hidden behind the counter. One final note: The tacos at this Tacombi are served with two thick tortillas apiece, a doubling-up strategy that only serves to bury the flavors further. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The Reigning Champ Yellow Rose , Dave and Krystiana Rizo's funky and funky restaurant featuring ""cosmic Texas cooking"" is, without question, one of my favorites places to eat in the East Village. The San Antonio-raised, Crown Heights-living couple both lost their jobs during the initial COVID-19 lockdown, Dave at Superiority Burger, Krystiana at Emmy Squared, and they opened Yellow Rose, located on Third Avenue near 13th Street, during that first pandemic fall of 2020 . Yellow Rose has evolved over the past three years, but one thing's remained constant: the absolute killer tacos. A close-up look at the Yellow Rose $4 masterpiece, the bean and cheese taco. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Seriously, these are big-flavored beasts, the housemade flour tortillas laden with simple, high-quality, sloppy-ass ingredients. The bean and cheese taco, for example, is phenomenal, though it's hard to say exactly why—it's just an oozing mound of refried beans, plus some shredded cheddar that's not even fully melted when it hits the table, with salsa served on the side. And yet, somehow it's one of the greatest dishes served anywhere in town. For your viewing pleasure, the Yellow Rose bean and cheese taco, $4; the shredded chicken verde taco, $6; the beef barbacoa taco, $7. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Also delicious: The beef barbacoa taco, the tender, slow-cooked beef cheeks sticky in their juices, a slab of avocado adding further heft and a bit of brightness. You can add on cotija to this beauty for a $1.50, but it doesn't necessarily need it. The chicken verde one is also a winner, though I think I prefer the carne guisada. Just follow your heart—you can't go wrong with anything at Yellow Rose . The Winner Yeah, no contest. Yellow Rose for life.

Tacombi CDMX Vs. Yellow Rose: A Taco Showdown in the East Village,https://hellgatenyc.com/tacombi-yellow-rose-taco-showdown-east-village-nyc,102 Third Avenue,"Yellow Rose (https://www.yellowrosenyc.com/), Yellow Rose (https://www.instagram.com/yellowrose.nyc/), Yellow Rose (https://www.instagram.com/yellowrose.nyc/)","102+Third+Avenue,+NYC",Yellow Rose,40.7325423441224,-73.9880687681341,https://www.yellowrosenyc.com/,,,,"""There are no good tacos in New York City "" has likely come out of the mouth of the laziest, most cliché-spouting and incorrect person in your life. Sure, there are plenty of bad tacos to be found in this town. But there are also a ton of terrible burgers out there, and innumerable sad, soggy slices of pizza. It's a big place, this city of ours, full of wonders and horrors in equal measure. One of the most consistently magical taco spots in NYC, which the semi-imaginary dude quoted above has clearly never been to, is Yellow Rose in the East Village, a restaurant whose ramshackle charms prove to be the perfect setting for some truly excellent rustic-ish Texan food. And then, about a month ago, the big-money-backed chain Tacombi opened a slick, CDMX-esque taqueria right down the block from Yellow Rose. Naturally, it's time for a taco showdown on Third Avenue. (And, yes, I know there's also that Taco Bell that opened last year right next door to Yellow Rose, but that shit is straight trash, sorry.) The Contender Earlier this summer in mid-July, a Tacombi opened up shop on East 12th Street, right off Third Avenue. This isn't really so newsworthy in and of itself. Ever since it got $27.5 million from Danny Meyer's investment group in 2021, the once-charming taco spot in Nolita has been on an expansion tear—except that here in the East Village, they're trying something new. Instead of Tacombi's usual Baja crispy fish, beef birria, and carnitas crowd-pleasers, this outpost is going full Mexico City, with a tight menu of CDMX street-vendor classics. First and foremost, there's the suadero taco, made from a cut of cow that Pete Wells wrote is sometimes called the fly shaker , because it's the muscle the animals use to twitch their flanks and, hopefully, discourage biting insects from settling in for supper. The choricero at the new Tacombi, in which they cook the suadero and the longaniza.

Abracadabra Magic Diner Brings Hippie Vibes and an Expansive Menu to Ridgewood,https://hellgatenyc.com/abracadabra-magic-diner-ridgewood-review,566 Onderdonk Avenue,Abracadabra Magic Diner (https://example.com/abracadabra-magic-diner),"566+Onderdonk+Avenue,+NYC",Abracadabra Magic Diner,40.7054607,-73.9099268,https://example.com/abracadabra-magic-diner,,,,"Dilara Erbay doesn't call herself a chef, though she's been cooking professionally since the start of this century. Her restaurants, workshops, and food installations—most notably her experimental Turkish spot in Istanbul called Abracadabra—have garnered her worldwide media attention and landed her an internship at Tribeca Grill. (The latter job may not have lasted that long, but made her fall in love with New York City.) Erbay is, as she puts it, more of a food artist. ""We believe in ourselves, and we believe in our hearts,"" she told Hell Gate. ""We become what we say. And here, 'abracadabra' is the magic word. We put our love and our spirit into our food."" Outside the Abracadabra Magic Diner. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Abracadabra Magic Diner, which opened in Ridgewood with limited hours in December, is the third New York City venture from Erbay and her partner Ahmet Bugdayci since they moved here with their son in 2012. It's also by far the largest. Located on the same corner where Onderdonk & Sons served burgers and such for a half-dozen years, Abracadabra Magic Diner is a trippy, art-filled space with seating for about 35 patrons. There's a long wooden bar up front; a communal table in the back; and four elevated, circular booths emblazoned with words like ""Joy"" and ""More Humanity"" that, should you snag one, will make you feel totally baller. Seating galore. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Bugdayci is the creative director, and seems to run the front-of-the house operation as well. He's also a shaman specializing in kambo medicine , whose practitioners burn the waxy secretions from the Amazonian giant monkey frog into your skin to heighten the senses—hence all the frogs you see around the restaurant. Bugdayci described the process to me as ""dying and being reborn"" (uh, no thank you), and conducts the ceremonies at the couple's Abracadabra Magic Farm in Coxsackie, New York. Watch out for the wax! (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The farm also provides food, some of which is used at the Abracadabra Magic Diner on a menu that's kind of scattershot cuisine-wise, but very hippie-ish and healthy, vibes-wise. Erbay explains: ""We think very globally, but we don't take it like, 'I am Turkish' or 'I am Egyptian.' We don't believe in nations, but we do believe in cultures."" This mindset means there's an excellent Turkish feta cheese and spinach borek sandwich here, a beautiful, eggy monster to which you can (and should) add slabs of sucuk, a funky, fiery Balkan sausage. It's one of the best brunch-y sandwiches in town, especially when slathered with Erbay's signature hot sauce. But there's also chicken tikka masala available, just because Erbay traveled to India and loved it. The saucy bird is served with greens, chickpeas, and a blob of her green hummus on coconut rice. Chicken tikka masala superfood magic bowl, $15. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Other ""superfood magic bowls"" include a protein-rich vegan option starring zaatar marinated roasted tofu; a big salmon salad; and Erbay's lentil balls, which she makes with quinoa rather than the more Turkish-traditional bulgur so that the dish is gluten-free. You can also get stuffed lavash wraps (she calls them ""Turkish burritos''); croissant French toast; a vegan omelet; and, in honor of the previous tenants, a straight-up Onderdonk burger with American cheese, onions, and pickles. Several pastries, which definitely fall on the more austere end of the dessert spectrum, are available as well. Turkish tapas (and alcohol) will be added when Erbay and Bugdayci snag a wine and beer license and expand the hours into the night. Lentil and quinoa balls superfood magic bowl, $16. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The current booze-free situation won't leave you thirsty, though. Abracadabra has smoothies that claim to boost your immune system, or your strength, or your libido, as well as ""healing teas,"" matcha drinks, mushroom coffee, and a whole cacao program. I enjoyed my cup of ""trust, love, and courage"" in the latter category—it had a shot of espresso and MCT oil—though after sucking it down, I'm not sure I felt any more of the three eponymous attributes than I usually walk around with. Take a seat. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) But whether Abracadabra provides you with palpable physical health benefits or not, the couple certainly have created a lively, welcoming gathering space, the type of cafe where it would probably be fine if you picked up one of those congas in the corner and started playing. ""We have a family business,"" said Erbay. ""Everybody does this for themselves to nourish themselves, and the community. It's more of a school, more of a ritual, more of a sharing experience. That's why it's magic."" Abracadabra Magic Diner is located at  566 Onderdonk Avenue, at the corner of Menahan Street, and is currently open on Tuesday through Sunday from 8 a.m to 4 p.m., with extended hours coming soon.

Prepare to Get Greasy With This Delicious Chicken on Bleecker Street,https://hellgatenyc.com/cauldron-chicken-dao-kou-shou-ji-bleecker-street-nyc,190 Bleecker Street,Cauldron Chicken (https://www.instagram.com/cauldronchicken/),"190+Bleecker+Street,+NYC",Cauldron Chicken,40.7291069,-74.001523,https://www.instagram.com/cauldronchicken/,,,,"There are some wild, animalistic pleasures to be had near the western end of Bleecker Street these days at Cauldron Chicken, a restaurant where you're all but ordered to rip apart and devour an entire delicious bird by hand. Cauldron Chicken—or, as the banner flying out over the sidewalk would have it, simply ""chicken shop""—serves a bird so slippery and tender that the skin slides effortlessly off the meat, the meat slides effortlessly off the bone, and it all piles up in a puddle of greasy drippings. There are no utensils here; you have to dive in with both hands to get the job done. (The restaurant staff do give you a pair of cheap plastic gloves to wear if you want, but what's the fun of that.) The chef and owner, who goes by just Ricky, good-naturedly declined to be formally interviewed by Hell Gate last Sunday evening because he was busy working on ""special projects"" in the back. But he did confirm that the recipe for Cauldron's signature chicken, the Dao Kou Shou Ji, was first created more than 300 years ago in the Henan town of Dao Kou, during the reign of the Qing Dynasty's Shunzhi Emperor. Another view of the half-chicken combo with one side (in this case scallion pancakes) and a soda, $17.95. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) According to my online sleuthing, the chicken is deep fried, then marinated in a secret spice mix, then braised in a big, burbling pot—the titular cauldron—for at least five hours before getting hacked up and served in a nifty compartmentalized wooden tray, which also houses a mound of chili powder for sprinkling or dipping; some random slivers of raw onion and a broccoli floret or two; and, if you order the combo, which you definitely should do, at least one side dish. Your options for those sides include mostly fried beige things like onion rings, french fries, spring rolls, gyoza, fried rice, and some first-rate scallion pancakes, which pleasantly matched the chicken in their degree of greasiness. Just for kicks, I ordered an additional side, a stack of snappy cucumbers swimming in a black vinegar sauce, and this seems like the way to go if you're seeking some contrast in your meal. (Again, you will have to eat all of this without the aid of any utensils.) Side of cucumbers in vinegar, $4.85. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There are a few other ways to get your chicken fix at Cauldron, such as chicken fingers, stir-fried chicken, chicken soup, and some seriously crisp and juicy chicken wings. This latter dish is served with a crock of ketchup. ""Chicken wings with ketchup?"" I exclaimed to my server in mock horror. She didn't bat an eye. ""Try it, it's delicious,"" she said. And you know what? She wasn't wrong. Six crispy fried chicken wings (with ketchup), $7.99 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Cauldron Chicken is located at 190 Bleecker Street, between MacDougal Street and Sixth Avenue, and is currently open on Sunday through Thursday from noon to 10 p.m., and on Friday and Saturday from 12:30 to 11:30 p.m. (646-869-8888) Already a user?

"Superb Sichuan Noodles, Served on an Industrial Corner in Queens",https://hellgatenyc.com/dutch-kills-fer-sichuan-restaurant-review,41-10 29th Street,Feng Shui Kitchen (https://example.com/feng-shui-kitchen),"41-10+29th+Street,+NYC",Fer,40.7509137,-73.9370599,https://example.com/feng-shui-kitchen,,,,"Approach the new Sichuan-Guizhou restaurant Fer after dark (so, these days, anytime after 5:00 p.m.) and you'll find yourself in an oasis of warmth and fellowship. Outside, the block is all construction sites, an MTA ventilation complex, and a looming, empty high school; inside, the small but mighty Fer is buzzing with noodle heads. Fer is not, despite what a cheeky Instagram post from the restaurant implied, so named because of its proximity to the Queens Plaza F, E, and R station. As Nigel Huang, one of the partners here, told Hell Gate, it's actually a punny transliteration of ""fen,"" or rice noodles. (I didn't really get the joke to be honest, but it doesn't matter because what came through loud and clear after my feast at Fer is that the food here is fantastic.) Outside of Fer, in Dutch Kills. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Huang, who's from the Sichuan province, said that Fer's dishes are almost all based on family recipes. ""A lot of Chinese restaurant owners in New York think they have to make changes to their food for Americans,"" he said. ""But we don't want to do that. We're trying to serve real Chinese food. We're trying to keep the legacy of our shifu [teachers] alive."" Noodles form the core of the menu, and each of the half-dozen or so main dishes at Fer can be made with either rice or egg noodles, and with or without broth. The ""Munchie Tripes"" bowl, which I had with the former and served ""dry,"" was glorious, full of funk and fire, the offal tender, the noodles slick, and the bok choy bringing some crunch. Juicy lamb with egg noodles, $14. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The ""Juicy Lamb"" bowl was equally good, with thin-sliced meat and egg noodles swimming in a rich broth made extra-luxurious by the inclusion of mutton fat. Other noodle pairings include the porky ""Heavenly Intestine,"" the braised beef, the spicy chicken, and two tofu options. Each is entree-sized, and costs $14 a pop. Bitter melon salad, $9. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Chicken broth wontons: $12. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) You'll probably want to split an additional, ancillary dish or three, depending on the size of your party (just for fun and also because everything is so good). The chilled bitter gourd salad, for example, makes for a welcome counterpoint to all the red meat and chili oil (be warned though: It is, indeed, quite bitter). So do the soothing chicken broth wontons. Cucumber salad, chewy chicken gizzard, and ""zesty pork tongue"" are among your other shareable side dish options. Fer is a spin-off of Burp Bowl Cafe in Kips Bay. But though the menu is similar, the design is decidedly different here in Dutch Kills. Huang is an architect as well as a restaurateur, and he said that he did all of the interior design and construction at Fer, including taking a hammer to the main wall and smashing out big chunks down to the brick. Huang's partners in the venture, Margaret Fang and Mimi Yang, also have a creative life beyond Fer—the former is a designer, the latter a landscape architect—and the trio are hoping to create a neighborhood gathering place here. There's even a communal table in the back. ""We have a very nice design here,"" said Huang. ""We're trying to create a space for people to walk in, enjoy a meal, and share their time with us and each other."" Fer is located 41-10 29th Street, at the corner of 41st Avenue, and is currently open from 11:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. daily. (347-649-1046) Already a user? Log in Thanks for reading!

El Rinconcito Is Back in Action with Delicious Dominican Fare,https://hellgatenyc.com/el-rinconcito-alphabet-city-review,264 East 10th Street,El Rinconcito (https://www.instagram.com/elrinconcito.nyc),"264+East+10th+Street,+NYC",El Rinconcito,40.7283022,-73.9837211,https://www.instagram.com/elrinconcito.nyc,,,,"The Rodriguez family fed their neighbors here in Alphabet City for some thirty years when they were forced to shut down El Rinconcito, their beloved luncheonette on East 10th Street, in 2021. The closure was mandated by the City, but it was for a happy reason: As Rinconcito's owner Pedro Rodriguez put it, the building (where the family also lives) is getting renovated and ""turned back over to the tenants"" by the NYS Homes and Community Renewal Program . Still, the family had to scramble. Rodriguez told me he found a new, even better spot for Rinconcito relatively quickly, down near 5th Street on a bustling stretch of Avenue C—but unfortunately, it took Con Edison more than a year to run bigger lines from the street to his new kitchen and turn on the gas. ""It was very difficult,"" he said. ""I was paying rent the whole time and we couldn't open. We survived COVID-19 but almost didn't survive Con Ed."" Outside El Rinconcito's new Avenue C storefront. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Inside the revamped El Rinconcito. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Finally, though, the new Rinconcito opened a couple of weeks ago. The place looks fantastic, with a banquette running along one wall, a few stools at the counter, and sweet touches like the flowers on every table. A steady stream of takeout customers ordered from the steam table the entire time I was there on a Monday afternoon and, as you may remember from the old place, the Rodriguez family and all the staff know how to make you feel welcome. The menu sprawls, and is packed with Dominican bangers. The signature dish here—it's literally called the Rinconcito—is a mountain of mofongo, those garlicky mashed green plantains, that's studded with glorious hunks of fatty, porky pernil, as well as funky longaniza sausage and chewy strips of pan-fried mozzarella cheese. It is amazing . Mofongo can be dry, but here it's served with a bowl of peppy tomato sauce for dipping. Small mondongo with bread, $7. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) My personal favorite at Rinconcito, now and forever, is their mondongo, a Dominican tripe soup. The dish is loaded with tender intestines, plus carrots and potatoes, in a broth so rich it feels like you can almost chew it. The mondongo comes with a basket of pressed, liberally buttered garlic bread, so even the smallest size can function as a meal. The chicharron de pollo is also first rate (get it con hueso, or bone-in, for extra gnawing pleasure), especially when paired with rice and beans. Do yourself a favor and dump on both the garlicky green and the vingary red hot sauces. Rodriguez is so proud of his wife Agueda Soha Rodriguez's pescado en coco, or fish in coconut sauce, that he sent out a sample size for me. ""I married her because of this dish,"" he said. I might have, too. A sample from the kitchen of Agueda Soha Rodriguez's pescado en coco. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There's so much other great stuff here, including sancocho, empanadas, chuletas, pollo asado, and all kinds of panini, including a killer cubano. Flan and tres leches cake are the obvious dessert choices, though neither are made in house (they're still good). Chicharron de pollo con hueso with rice and beans, $15. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""I grew up in this neighborhood, lived here since 1984,"" Rodriguez said, but he wasn't about to wax rhapsodic about the bad old days. ""I like it now. It's a lot more expensive, but everything is cleaner and safer, with no burned cars in the street, no burned-out buildings."" This checks out. I'm not going to say exactly what I used to buy on 5th and C in the early '80s inside one of those abandoned buildings, but it definitely wasn't a nice bowl of soup. A bustling Monday. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Mostly though, Rodriguez is just happy to be open and working again, while actively contributing to his community. ""There's a lot of great people in this area, and we've received a lot of support,"" he said. ""I like the way everything is going, the way people are reacting to us. It's a good feeling."" El Rinconcito is located at 73-75 Avenue C, between East 5th and East 6th Streets, and is currently open on Monday through Saturday from 8:00 a.m to 9:00 p.m. Already a user?

Greenpoint’s Restaurant Row Gets a Nifty New Japanese Sando Shop,https://hellgatenyc.com/taku-sando-japanese-greenpoint-nyc,29 Greenpoint Avenue,"Radio Star (https://www.bkmag.com/2023/11/19/team-glasserie-opens-delightful-radio-star-right-next-to-transmitter-park/), Taku Sando (https://www.takusando.com/), Taku Sando (https://www.instagram.com/taku_sando/?hl=en)","29+Greenpoint+Avenue,+NYC",Radio Star,40.7298638,-73.9596512,https://www.bkmag.com/2023/11/19/team-glasserie-opens-delightful-radio-star-right-next-to-transmitter-park/,,,,"Remember when the dominant feature of the Greenpoint skyline was the water tower that read "" Save the Palestine ""? Those days are long gone, as spanking new luxury residential buildings now line the waterfront all the way up to Newtown Creek, coupled with an attendant transformation of the neighborhood's whole vibe at retail level. Perhaps most startling, however, is the emergence this past year of a bona fide restaurant row at the butt end of Greenpoint Avenue, where today, seven (and soon to be eight) spots are lined down the once-barren block in back-to-back fashion before it hits bucolic Transmitter Park. True, the original Ovenly has been holding it down over here since 2012, but everything else, including the excellent Lingo and Radio Star , all opened just recently. And now, a terrific little sandwich shop called Taku Sando has entered the fray, whipping up a tight menu of first-rate Japanese sandos with a decidedly American twist. Namely—unlike what you might find in, say, Tokyo, these beasts are stuffed to overflowing. ""The traditional Japanese sando has a different shape, and is more organized, than what we're serving here,"" said Taku Sando co-owner and creative director Kiyo Shinoki, who grew up in the Saitama prefecture north of Tokyo but has lived in Brooklyn for 15 years. ""Americans like big portions. Big ingredients, tiny bread, like Katz's. So these are American-style sandos."" Tonkatsu sando, $16; tamago sando, $12.50. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Either way, they're very good. Two katsu creations are the headliners, one pork, the other chicken, and in both cases, the meat is marinated overnight before getting covered in panko and fried, so it's nice and tender and juicy. Shredded cabbage brings further crunch to the party, the house sauce adds a touch of sweetness, and the karashi mustard mayo has a bit of bite. There's also a pickle involved, though it's place haphazardly. One bite can be all pickle; the next, no pickle at all. The egg salad is not the sleeper hit at Taku Sando—it's good, but pretty basic—but the korokke, or potato croquette, sando definitely has potential in that category, the two fat fried spuds crackling on the outside, fluffy within, and costarring enough spicy karashi mustard to clear your sinuses. Shinoki says he's hoping to add seasonal sando specials to the menu in the coming weeks and months, as well as collabs with his many new Greenpoint neighbors. Classic korokke (potato) sando, $14 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Holding everything together is the squishy housemade shokupan, or Japanese milk bread. The restaurant makes 50 loaves a day, and when they're gone, Taku Sando closes up shop. The place was hopping during its opening week, so I'd advise going on the early side to avoid any no-sando sadness. Prepping that sweet, sweet shokupan. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Supplementing the sandos are bowls of fun, chewy ribbon fries, which are like those tornado potato sticks you see at every food market in town these days, minus the stick aspect. You can get these simply salted or, better idea, well-seasoned with dashi furikake for a fishy kick. There's also a vegan furikake version. A couple of umami-rich salads round out the food offerings. Taku Sando sells booze if you want it—beer, wine, sake—as well as tea and coffee, but the potent handcrafted yuzu ginger ale is my beverage pick. Ribbon fries, $7.50 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Taku Sando is run by the same team that does the ramen and rice bowl izakaya Takumen across the creek in Long Island City, but they decided to go the sando route here in Brooklyn because, as Shinoki put it, Greenpoint is really cool. ""Greenpoint feels like my favorite places in Tokyo, Harajuku and Nakameguro ,"" Shinoki told Hell Gate. ""There are so many hip independent stores and local shops around here. And a sandwich shop just makes it easy to grab a bite and catch up with friends."" Having Transmitter Park right there adds to the picnic-hang appeal of the place, of course, but really, the backyard of Taku Sando is spacious and spiffy as hell— just a really chill, comfortable spot to wolf some sandwiches with a buddy or two and forget for a moment about all those hundreds of new, completely unaffordable apartments looming above. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Taku Sando is located at 29 Greenpoint Avenue, between West Street and Transmitter Park, and is currently open on Wednesday through Sunday from noon to 8 p.m., or until the shokupan runs out. Closed Monday and Tuesday. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Already a user? Log in Thanks for reading!

America’s Top ‘Burger Scholar’ Opens Hamburger America in SoHo. Class Is in Session,https://hellgatenyc.com/hamburger-america-george-motz-soho-nyc,51 MacDougal Street,"Hamburger America (https://www.georgemotz.com/), Superiority Burger (https://hellgatenyc.com/superiority-burger-lives-up-to-high-expectations), Hamburger America (https://www.hamburgeramerica.com/)","51+MacDougal+Street,+NYC",Hamburger America,40.7279106,-74.0024025,https://www.georgemotz.com/,,,,"It seems safe to say that there are few people in the entire world who know as much about hamburgers as George Motz . A self-proclaimed ""burger scholar,"" Motz had a show on the Travel Channel for a couple of years called ""Burger Land;"" made a documentary film and wrote a book celebrating regional burger variations; and in 2005, taught an actual course on the topic at NYU . Burgers are his profession, burgers are his passion, and he's cooked hundreds of thousands of them over the years at pop-ups across the country. And now, Motz finally has a permanent home where he can share all his burger love and lore on a daily basis—the brand-new Hamburger America, a charming restaurant with serious diner vibes on the northwest edge of SoHo. Burger scholar George Motz feeding the faithful. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""Burgers are beautiful,"" Motz told Hell Gate as he manned Hamburger America's grill before an eager, watchful lunchtime crowd earlier this week. ""Everybody understands them, you've probably had different versions of them your whole life, and I truly believe it's one of the great equalizers in the world of American food."" He added, ""In the gastronomic fabric of America, there are very few things that can be traced back to their roots right here, and be appreciated by everybody. It's utilitarian food, and you can find it in high-end restaurants. It's one of the greatest things you can make to feed someone."" There are two burgers on the menu during Hamburger America's current soft-opening phase, both available as a single or a double. (You definitely don't need to order the double for a satisfying meal, but it does make for a pretty awesome meat-eating experience.) Double fried onion burger, $11.50. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The headliner is Motz's Oklahoma fried onion burger, a regional style which he says goes back at least 100 years. Sit at the counter and watch as he plops a baseball-sized mound of ground chuck onto the grill, salts it like a road, blankets it in finely shredded raw onions, then smashes it all down with impunity. After a single flip, he adds a slice of American, then puts the soft white bun on while it's still on the grill, so everything gets fused together. It's a charred-to-hell, greasy, cheesy, meaty masterpiece. Also excellent is Motz's classic smash burger, which should be ordered ""all the way"" with pickles, diced onion, cheese, mustard, and definitely not ketchup, which Motz famously scoffs at as being too sweet for a burger condiment. Hamburger America will also soon have a rotating cast of special limited-edition burgers, with a different regional creation highlighted each month. First up is Michigan chef Autumn Weston's olive burger, followed by Jack Keller's ""The No. 5"" from Dallas, and then Wisconsinite Glenn Fieber's butter burger. Things that aren't burgers here include some good shoestring fries, a nostalgia-inducing grilled cheese that cries out for tomato soup, and—sleeper hit alert—a lovely, creamy egg salad sandwich. Grilled cheese on white, $5. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) And there's a whole section of milks to wash it all down, from regular whole to chocolate to mocha to a super-sweet and extremely good coffee milk, which is apparently a thing in Rhode Island. There's no need for dessert if you have a glass of this stuff, but you can also get a couple of decent chocolate chip cookies or a slice of key lime pie from Greenpoint's Pie Corps if you want, no one will stop you. Sleeper hit alert: this egg salad sandwich on white toast, $7. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The entrance to Hamburger America is on Houston Street near Sixth Avenue, but the space sprawls all the way over and back to MacDougal. The most fun place to perch is at the counter, which gives you a front-row seat to the show at the grill, but the back dining room has booths and tables if you want to spread out and chill a bit. And Motz totally pulls off the diner vibe. The place is charming and comfortable and familiar, like S&P , or Salty Lunch Lady , or Superiority Burger , rather than feeling like some sort of Americana theme park. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Hamburger America is located at 51 MacDougal Street, though the entrance is on Houston Street. Motz is still in soft open mode while he staffs up, but it's generally open from noon to 8 p.m. Check Hamburger America's Instagram Stories to see if it's open that day before heading over.

Hyderabadi Zaiqa in Hell’s Kitchen Serves Some of the Best Biryani You’ll Ever Eat,https://hellgatenyc.com/hyderabadi-zaiqa-hells-kitchen-best-biryani,366 West 52nd Street,Hyderabadi Zaiqa (https://hyderabadizaiqa.com/),"366+West+52nd+Street,+NYC",Hyderabadi Zaiqa,40.7643836,-73.9876243,https://hyderabadizaiqa.com/,,,,"You could walk by Hyderabadi Zaiqa a hundred times without giving the place a second glance. The subterranean space, sandwiched between a nondescript ramen shop and a burger joint on West 52nd Street, has a certain freshness to it, to be sure—it's only been open about five months—but unless you do a deep dive into the somewhat overwhelming menu displayed on one of its sidewalk stands, you might miss the headline here: Hyderabadi Zaiqa specializes in biryani, and it's some of the best you'll ever eat. ""When I first came to New York three years ago, I didn't see any Hyderabadi restaurants,"" Mohammad Tarique Khan, one of the restaurant's three chef-partners, told Hell Gate. ""So that was my dream, to one day open one."" He added of Hyderabadi cuisine, ""They cook everything there all together in a slow flame, all marinated one night before, and the spices are so different from other regions of India."" Tarique Khan, who also did a stint at Eleven Madison Park, should know. He started his career in Hyderabad, and then traveled for work all over the subcontinent—""India has so much diversity, so many different cultures, so many different cooking techniques,"" he said—and then went all over the world, hitting 52 countries in total. So even if you've had tons of biryani in New York City before, the version served at Hyderabadi Zaiqa is still an eye-opening delight. Hyderabadi goat dum biryani, $17.99. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The flavor is incredible, starting with the basmati rice: It's loose, chewy, and infused with enough saffron to get your attention. And there are some 16 different varieties available, both vegetarian and extremely meaty, so you're not going to get stuck in a biryani rut here any time soon. The signature Hyderabadi goat dum biryani is the obvious place to start. The slow-cooked goat meat falls off the bone, and is just unbelievably tender and redolent with special, secret, spicy seasonings. You get a generous portion of meat too, much of it buried under the rice. It's a full meal for sure. The goongura chicken biryani is also awesome, and also ample, with plenty of dark meat on the bone to gnaw your way through. Both biryanis come with a gravy boat's worth of yogurt sauce, bringing some brightness and tang to the party. I loved it all. Goongura chicken biryani, $15.99. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) And Hyderabadi Zaiqa is by no means a one-hit-wonder. There are, like, 60 other items on the menu, about half of them vegetarian, from soups and samosas, naan and chat, to all kinds of curry, tandoori chicken, paneer, and some Indo-Chinese dishes. I asked Tarique Khan to recommend a dish to supplement our biryani bash and his suggestion, the dum ka murgh, which involved chicken thighs in a rich, creamy sauce, was a banger. Dum ka murgh (chicken thigh), $14.99. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) You can order with confidence here, no matter where your cravings guide you. What you can't do here, however, is sit in an actual chair while you eat. Hyderabadi Zaiqa has three tables flanked by those squat, metal, backless stools, plus an eating counter with taller versions of the same. You also can't drink booze, but for me, the mango lassi was perfect. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Hyderabadi Zaiqa is located at 366 West 52nd Street, just east of Ninth Avenue, and is currently open from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily, with a break in service between 3 and 4 p.m. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Already a user?

Get Excellent Homestyle Korean Food At This Bed-Stuy Coffee Shop,https://hellgatenyc.com/sonbul-korean-food-burly-bed-stuy,356 Throop Avenue,Homestyle Korean Food (https://example.com/homestyle-korean-food),"356+Throop+Avenue,+NYC",Homestyle Korean Food,40.6920119,-73.9429046,https://example.com/homestyle-korean-food,,,,"In early 2020, Taeil Kim was happily barista-ing away at Burly Coffee on Throop Avenue in Bed-Stuy. He'd been living in the neighborhood for about four years at that point, and, as he told Hell Gate, the job ""made me a consistent enough income to keep me alive in this city."" A reasonable goal for sure! You know what happened next: COVID tore through town, businesses shut down, lives were upended, and Kim decided he needed to rethink his path and get his own thing going.  And so we have Sonbul, Kim's ""LA Street and Home Comfort Korean Food"" spot that, after nearly two and half years of popping up all over Brooklyn, is now permanently ensconced, four nights a week (soon to be five) at Burly. ""I've always been good at cooking, just in general,"" Kim said. ""And my dad runs a restaurant in Long Beach [California], so I grew up around the hospitality industry. Plus there wasn't really much in the way of Asian food in Bed-Stuy, so maybe there is a place for Korean?"" (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Kim started by setting up Sonbul ""at Burly, at bars, at raves, at people's parties, anywhere I could. It was very underground for a while. I'd just be out on the sidewalk in front of places at night. There weren't really any regulations during those times, and a lot of really cool food popups came about."" Sonbul at Burly had its grand opening last weekend with a tight ten-item menu of killer Korean dishes—Kim converted the coffee shop's backroom into a commercial kitchen—and will be serving dinner from Wednesday through Saturday, and soon on Sunday too, from now until whenever. ""I learned how to cook from my family, and a lot of these are home recipes. Like my dad gave me the family kimchi recipe, so I use that here."" Kimchi cheesesteak sandwich with potato wedges, $15 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The Kim kimchi is very good, and is featured in multiple different ways: with pa-jeon, for example, the Korean-style scallion pancakes; or cooked with a whole mess of fried rice; or sitting atop a superb cheesesteak made with tender bulgogi beef on a soft hero roll. The sandwich also comes with some well-seasoned potato wedges, and is definitely a complete, and delicious, meal. Also soul-satisfying is Kim's pork don-kat-su, which he makes with pork belly for added fat and flavor. The fried breaded exterior crackles, the meat is juicy as hell, and sides of good, sticky rice and dressed shredded cabbage bring additional heft to your dinner. Sonbul dosirak with LA-style galbi, banchan, and dumplings, $20 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Sonbul's dosirak, which is like a bento box, comes with one of several different main dishes, like fried tofu, bulgogi, or a terrific galbi, those Korean short ribs that Kim says he prepares here like they do on the streets of LA. If you can, I would suggest filling out your dosirak with a trio of Kim's first-rate fried pork-and-kimchi dumplings. Other things available now at Sonbul include Korean fried chicken (wings or ""popcorn""), bibimbap with or without meat, spicy rice cakes, and Kim's kimmari, which are bundles of deep-fried seaweed stuffed with noodles. In addition to expanding the hours of the place, Kim also plans on adding Korean stews to the menu for the winter. It's important to him, however, that any growth in the business doesn't come at the expense of his, or his employees, quality of life. ""I want to create a work environment that doesn't feel exploitative,"" he said. ""The hospitality industry can be like that, profiteering for owners and investors at the expense of the workers. I'm trying to move forward in a way that I can provide a consistent income for people working for me. To create an environment that isn't toxic, just a nice place to work."" Sonbul at Burly is located at 356 Throop Avenue, between DeKalb Avenue and Kosciuszko Street, and is currently open on Wednesday through Saturday from 5:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Already a user?

World-Class Pizza and Australian Sushi Rolls Make for a Killer Christopher Street Combo,https://hellgatenyc.com/lindustrie-sushi-counter-christopher-street-review,104 Christopher Street,Sushi Counter (https://www.instagram.com/sushicounternyc/%C2%A0),"104+Christopher+Street,+NYC",Sushi Counter,40.7332224,-74.0049081,https://www.instagram.com/sushicounternyc/%C2%A0,,,,"Christopher Street is only seven blocks long (or a couple more, if you want to include the eponymous pier jutting out over the Hudson). But its importance in the city's history, and in the world's collective understanding of what New York ""is,"" far outstrips its size. Unlike other iconic NYC destinations, the West Village strip hasn't been totally ceded to the tourists, continuing to resist mall-ification with a recent surge of new openings that even the most jaded New Yorkers would find it hard to resist, like the terrific pie-crust-cookie shop Janie's, the woman-owned brewery Talea, and the excellent French bistro Libertine. Now two new counter service spots between Bleecker and Bedford are bringing still more good vibes and great food to the block: a second location of L'Industrie, one of the city's absolute best slice shops; and plucky newcomer Sushi Counter, which specializes in Australian-style sushi rolls. Both are very welcome additions to your eating options, for lunch and dinner, in this part of town. L'Industrie (Part II) The new West Village location. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The fact that Massimo Laveglia and Nick Baglivo opened their new L'Industrie in the West Village is total random amazing luck for the locals. ""You don't find the space,"" Baglivo told Hell Gate, ""The space finds you. You get something that works because it works. That's how it goes."" Zen pronouncements aside, the new L'Industrie has seating for about 20 people inside at tables and counter stools, a full menu of slices, pies, and desserts, and, so far, a line running out the door during most of the day and night. And for good reason! The pizza here is outstanding, a combination of Italian ingredients, know-how—Laveglia is from Pistoia, in Tuscany—and love, done up as classic NYC folds. Margherita ($3.50), L'Industrie with burrata and prosciutto ($7.50), pepperoni ($4.50), tartufo with mushrooms and ricotta ($5.50). (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) On opening day, my party made quick work of four slices: a baseline margherita, a pepperoni, a tartufo (mozzarella, mushrooms, ricotta, and just the exact right amount of truffle oil), and the shop's most extravagant offering, the L'Industrie, which features both burrata and prosciutto on top. These are all fucking awesome slices of pizza. A lot is made of Laveglia's long fermentation process for making the dough, and the crust here is, in fact, pretty extraordinary: It's thin but sturdy, chewy but light, funky and tangy and charred in all the right places. You don't have to know the details to appreciate how delicious it is. Besides, Baglivo said that they change up the recipe, and the processes, all the time, constantly tinkering to ensure that, as he put it, ""we do what we want to do, and do it well."" Superb construction. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Stop by L'Industrie on a Wednesday if you can, the only day (for now!) that sandwiches are available, and get whatever weekly special they're slinging. The chicken caesar sandwich we split totally ruled, just an absolute juicy ass monster of a meal, but other musts in this department include the meatball parm, and the chicken vodka, and the grilled mortadella. Sandwiches are served Wednesdays only for now. This is the Julius Caesar ($20) and it's huge and delicious. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There are slices of cake and bomboloni for dessert, on display in a little cabinet by the register, plus specials like homemade tiramisu and, best of all, a rotating selection of soft serve gelato. We got the pineapple and concord grape combo swirl, drizzled with olive oil, which had us swooning. There's beer and wine, too, if that's your thing. Concord grape and pineapple soft serve, $6.50. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Basically, L'Industrie West Village is divine, though right now, given the line situation, it's probably best not to show up at anything resembling prime time with a plan of ""just grabbing a slice."" Maybe congestion will ease when Frank Tuttolomondo opens his big new location of the equally stellar Mama's Too a half a block away on Bleecker Street, and NYC pizza fiends can spread out a bit. The line at L'Industrie at 5:45 p.m. on a Friday. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Sushi Counter Customers lining up outside of Sushi Corner. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Across the street and about five doors west is Melbourne native Alex Marks's Sushi Counter, a tiny shop specializing in Australian hand rolls, which is a thing I didn't know existed until a few weeks ago. What makes these Aussie? Some of it is just format. These aren't your standard conical hand rolls; they're more like cut rolls that haven't been cut. They're fat, architecturally sound, very portable, and about four bites long. This style is not exclusive to Australia, to be sure, but, as confirmed by my younger daughter currently living in Sydney, it is ubiquitous down (under) there. Owner Alex Marks works Sushi Counter's counter. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Some of the fillings, too, are not things you usually associate with sushi, but are apparently hugely popular in Australia. There's a teriyaki chicken roll, for example, and a cooked tuna one, both of which are flagged by Marks as ""very Australian."" More standard flavors include spicy tuna and salmon avo, and there are two vegan offerings, a miso eggplant and an avo cucumber. It takes about four big bites to get through one of these. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Spicy tuna, teriyaki chicken, miso eggplant, cooked tuna, $5 each or 3 for $12. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) All four rolls I had were very enjoyable. The nori snaps, the rice is firm and vinegary, the fillings well-balanced, and the whole thing is served just-made fresh at room temperature. The price is pleasant too: $5 each or three for $12. Marks hands you your rolls in a bag, along with a packet of pickled ginger, a packet of wasabi, and an undeniably charming, if environmentally unsound, squeezable plastic fish filled with enough drops of soy sauce for at least two rolls. There are a couple of tables on the sidewalk out front, and a window seat inside, but otherwise you'll have to find a stoop to squat on while you eat. Environmentally problematic but undeniably cute soy sauce dispensers. These are apparently very common in Sydney. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Sushi Counter is Marks's first restaurant—the chef here, Alex Matos, has more experience, having spent many years in places like Shinn East and Sushi Seki—and, as she told Hell Gate: ""It's been an adventure."" ""I've been in NYC for just over two years, and was a lawyer until about six months ago when I decided that wasn't my passion in life,"" Marks said. ""I wanted to do something different. We have places like Sushi Counter on most corners in Melbourne and Sydney, and I've really missed that, so I decided to open one."" And despite some briefly viral online accusations of cultural appropriation led by some dude in North Carolina , the reaction among New Yorkers has been incredibly welcoming, Marks said. In fact, she and chef Matos sell out at both lunch and dinner every day, so get here early. ""Lots of Aussies come in here wide-eyed with excitement,"" she said. ""But it's mostly been Americans, which has been lovely."" The West Village L'Industrie is located at 104 Christopher Street, between Bleecker and Bedford Streets, and is currently open daily from 12:00 noon to 10:00 p.m. (212-256-0648) Sushi Counter is located at 119 Christopher Street, between Bleecker and Bedford, and is currently open on Wednesday through Sunday at 12:00 noon for lunch (until sell out), and at 5:00 for dinner (until sell out).

Pizzalujah: Frank Tuttolomondo Brings His Awe-Inspiring Slices to the West Village,https://hellgatenyc.com/mamas-too-frank-tuttolomondo-west-village-pizza-nyc-review,325 Bleecker Street,Mama's Too West Village (https://example.com/frank-tuttolomondo),"325+Bleecker+Street,+NYC",Mama's Too West Village,40.7332891,-74.0040441,https://example.com/frank-tuttolomondo,,,,"Frank Tuttolomondo, the owner and head pizzaiolo of the consistently—and often astonishingly—great Mama's Too, didn't plan on getting into the pizza game. True, his grandmother had a slice shop called Mama's on the Upper West Side which she'd been running since 1959, and yes, his uncles all worked there, but Tuttolomondo was a Queens kid. He didn't spend a ton of time on Amsterdam Avenue growing up. It was in his blood, but not really in his blood. Fortunately for us, Tuttolomondo hated school. So when his grandmother announced that she was retiring from Mama's, with his uncles soon to follow, and his mother said she wasn't interested in taking over, Tuttolomondo saw a career opportunity for himself—and the perfect excuse to drop out of college. ""My professor pissed me off one day and I walked out of class and never went back,"" he told Hell Gate. ""I went straight to the pizzeria. This was in 2008, and I've pretty much never left."" Pizza heaven. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Tuttolomondo learned the basics of pizza-making at Mama's, but over time, he became frustrated by the menu's limitations there. ""For 60 years, for generations before me, people had been coming to that pizzeria and ordering the same thing,"" he said. ""I couldn't do anything else. I literally put all the stuff I make today at the end of the counter there, and no one would touch it. I couldn't give it away."" The only way he could make the type of pizza he wanted was to expand, so at the end of 2017, Tuttolomondo opened a sliver of a slice shop over on Broadway called Mama's Too. Big crowds; big-name critical acclaim ; and, for me and my daughters, dozens (hundreds?) of amazing slices followed. Seriously: Mama's Too has been our UWS go-to and special -occasion spot since early 2018, and every time I go, I'm newly awed at how good this pizza is. Last-minute window cleaning on opening day last Saturday. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) And now, there are two Mama's Too locations in town. This past weekend, Tuttolomondo flung open the doors to his enormous new pizzeria in the West Village, and it is a glorious beast to behold. First of all, he now has a whopping eight electric ovens cranking out pies and heating up slices—he said he engineered the place to handle 800 amps, which is like two whole apartment buildings worth of juice—so that every day he can offer every type of pie in his repertoire. The Mama's Too pizza is unlike any other in the city. ""Every different characteristic of pizza I incorporate into Mama's Too are things from other styles that I like,"" said Tuttolomondo. ""I love the robust and fresh flavors of the Neapolitan pizza, but I hate the soupiness aspect of it. I love the New York slice, I just don't love the greasy, floppy-ness of it. It's kind of a New York-style Sicilian, but with the light and airy aspect of the pizza from Rome."" Square slices are $6.75 each, and the ""house"" triangle slice is $5. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) I've never had anything but an awesome slice at Mama's Too. I usually just order at random, knowing I'll be happy no matter what—though, if forced to list my favorites, I'd probably include the creamy cacio e pepe, the bright and saucy ""upside down,"" the fiery ""angry nonna"" with hot soppressata and hot honey, the funky pepperoni, and the also-funky funghi. And the vodka. And the newish Florentine. Those are all big, fat, square slices, and we usually also get a triangle ""house"" slice too, just because it rules. House slice, $5. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The kitchen and prep areas sprawl at the new place, which means Tuttolomondo can serve his (also excellent) sandwiches all the time in the West Village, instead of just once a week. On opening day, that meant our party split a sexy, messy monster of a chicken cutlet hero, oozing vodka sauce, stracciatella, and pesto from its crusty house-baked sesame roll. Other masterpieces will make their way into the rotation here as well: a porchetta and rabe, a cheesesteak, and a meatball parm for the ages. Splitting a sandwich and a couple of slices is the pro move here, and it's more than enough food for two. Chicken alla vodka sandwich with mozzarella and pesto, $20. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There's seating for about 30 people at the Bleecker Street location, which is excellent news for everyone (me) who's ever stood on that sidewalk uptown wolfing slices in the rain. I mean, the freaking walk-in downstairs in the basement here is bigger than his entire shop uptown! And once things settle a bit after the crazy busy opening, Tuttolomondo will be scooping his stellar gelato daily as well. ""One thing I really look forward to here in the West Village is that there's room to bring the hospitality factor back into the business,"" he said. ""Uptown, you come in, order your pizza, and get the fuck out. There's nowhere to even stand. Down here, we'll have lots of customers inside, with time to relax and look at what we have. It'll be more accessible, more fun, and a cool place to hang out."" Mama's Too West Village is located at 325 Bleecker Street, just south of Christopher Street, and is currently open daily from noon to 10 p.m. The big tables in the front windows are the baller spots here.

NYC’s Wonton Queen Maxi Lau Blesses Flushing (Again) With Her Second Noodle Shop,https://hellgatenyc.com/best-wontons-nyc-maxis-noodle-2-flushing-review,59-20 Main Street,Maxi Lau (https://example.com/maxi-lau),"59-20+Main+Street,+NYC",Maxi Lau,40.7433137,-73.8259106,https://example.com/maxi-lau,,,,"Ever since she could remember, Maxi Lau always wanted to open a restaurant. She—and, subsequently, we —have her mom to thank for that. ""I started this whole restaurant business because of my mother,"" Lau told Hell Gate. ""We lived in Hong Kong until I was nine, moving to Long Island in 1997, and it was always her dream to open up a wonton noodle shop."" To that end, Lau's mom traveled to Toronto to learn the art of wontons from family friends who own a string of renowned noodle shops in Canada as well as in Hong Kong. After returning to New York, however, she was diagnosed with breast cancer before she could see her dream come to fruition. ""When my mother passed away, those same family friends reached out and offered to teach me,"" Lau said. ""This was in 2017. It changed my life."" Lau started with popups, taking over her aunt's Hong Kong-style coffee shop, Kissena Cafe, in the evenings. Then an unexpected Pete Wells rave in the New York Times about her wontons fast-tracked the whole operation, and in September of 2019, she opened her first Maxi's Noodle, snagging a prime location on 38th Avenue in Flushing. Lau really wanted to expand into Manhattan for Maxi's Noodle 2, and said she was ""so close"" to signing for a place on Elizabeth Street. Instead, it's Flushing that gets more Maxi for now, with this spanking new corner spot on Main Street, near Flushing Meadows Corona Park. For Lau, opening her second Maxi's so close to the first has its advantages. All of her team lives in Flushing, she said, so it makes staffing a lot easier. And the kitchen at the new spot is huge, so she can wrap all of her wontons for both restaurants here, and free up some much-needed space at her original location. So why all the fuss about a second noodle joint in Flushing, you say? Aren't there already plenty of places to get wontons around here? Yes—but none like Lau's. First off, the Maxi's wontons are enormous—""Americanized and super-sized"" is how Lau put it—almost three times as big as you'd find at, say, Chinatown's Wu's Wonton King. Secondly, they're made almost entirely of shrimp. ""A lot of wontons have mostly pork and maybe like one shrimp inside,"" she said. ""Mine are 90 percent shrimp and 10 percent pork."" Six wontons in soup, $10.75. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) More important, the wontons at Maxi's are superb, the wrinkled wrapper nice and thin but still plenty sturdy, the stuffing delivering that sweet snap of perfectly cooked crustacean. Spoon on some of that chili oil and they're probably the best in the city. You can get your wontons swimming in a big bowl of lovely broth, which you will definitely want to drink down at the end, or plopped atop your choice of noodle (duck egg, flat rice, vermicelli, or udon) with a cup of broth served on the side. There's no wrong answer here, so just trust your cravings. There are seven different topping options as well, including some excellent beef tendon; extremely large fish balls; and the sweet pork and mushroom sauce, zha jiang. Beef stew, made with an uncle's secret recipe, and fried fish skin are also available. There's no booze, but the iced Hong Kong milk tea hits the spot. Duck egg noodles with three toppings: dace fish balls, zha jiang, and beef tendon, $15.75. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""We literally built our business by word of mouth,"" said Lau. ""I don't do any advertising, and only recently did any social media stuff. I don't have time, I'm running the kitchen! I'm running the whole store! But people have been so supportive in Flushing."" It's easy to see why. Maxi's Noodle 2 is located at 59-20 Main Street, on the corner of 60th Avenue, and is currently open from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily. (917-508-3288) (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Already a user?

Sen Saigon Is Throwing a Vegan Vietnamese Party on East Broadway,https://hellgatenyc.com/sen-saigon-vegan-vietnamese-east-broadway-chinatown-nyc,150 E Broadway,Sen Saigon (https://www.instagram.com/sensaigon.nyc),"150+E+Broadway,+NYC",Sen Saigon,40.7143761480397,-73.990988107691,https://www.instagram.com/sensaigon.nyc,,,,"The origin story of Sen Saigon, a vegan Vietnamese spot that opened last weekend on East Broadway, is an unusually dramatic (and bloody!) one, at least as far as counter-service restaurants go. The chef here is An Nguyen Hawks, who was born and raised in and around Ho Chi Minh City before moving to New York City in 2014. She, her husband and business partner Erik Hawks, and their young son lived in Greenpoint before they decamped to Sunnyside. The Hawkses were lifelong omnivores until about four years ago, when, as Hawks told Hell Gate, their kid had a mishap. ""He got a big cut on his finger because he slammed it in the door,"" she recalled. ""There was a lot of blood and suffering going on. I'm not religious, but I told myself, if my son heals well, I won't eat meat for a month. He was fine, I kept my promise, and I never went back to eating meat."" Hawks discovered that she loved being vegetarian, and she became a vegan soon after. And she realized that it was almost impossible to find good plant-based Vietnamese food in the city. So she taught herself how to make her favorite dishes, sans meat—and Sen Saigon was born. ""I didn't miss the meat, but I did miss the traditional foods of home,"" she said. ""So I learned how to recreate them in vegan versions, which brought me a lot of joy and fun."" Judging how packed and festive Sen Saigon was on its soft-opening day last Saturday, plenty of other people want to get in on the party too. Even with a limited menu and days of prep, the team sold out of stuff several times, and had to scramble to keep making more. Bánh mì with tofu, mushrooms, and lemongrass, $11.75. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Hawks doesn't use commercially produced ""mock meat"" at Sen Saigon, so the bánh mì here, for example, relies on well-seasoned tofu and a funky mushroom and nut paté of her own creation to bring the sandwich's familiar flavors forward. The lemongrass helps in that regard as well. The best thing we ate was the bún huế. The soup's vegan broth has a rich, lively presence, and the ample ingredients—tangles of spaghetti-like noodles, a slab of fried tofu, some greens and cabbage and carrots, plus Hawks's own vegan Vietnamese ham—give the dish plenty of heft. Bún huế, $18.25. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The menu will expand in the coming weeks, but for now, your starter options include a crunchy lotus root salad, a pair of terrific mushroom and lemongrass summer rolls, and three takes on crisp-fried spring rolls, which we had stuffed with corn. There's no booze at Sen Saigon, but the housemade iced bean tea and vegan Thai coffee both hit the spot. And for dessert, there's Hawks's vegan flan, which doesn't quite pull off the eggy richness of my favorite flans around town, but does offer a bit of that burnt-caramel bite. The space is crammed nearly to chaos with tables and people waiting on line to order at the counter in the back, though the mirrors along one wall, flanked by shutters to create the illusion of windows, help alleviate any claustrophobia. Besides, there's too much of Hawks's ""fun and joy"" in the air here for anyone to feel stressed. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""My main purpose of this is, I just want to share the food with everyone. Everyone is welcome,"" she said. ""I really hope people give it a try. I was so nervous when I opened the doors [on opening day] whether we'd have customers, and the moment we opened people came in. It's been wonderful."" Sen Saigon is located at 150 East Broadway, just west of Rutgers Street, and is currently open on Friday through Sunday, from noon to 7 p.m. Expect more days in the near future, and the menu will expand as well.

Make Your Way to Flatbush’s Yaadman Thing for NYC’s Best Curry Goat,https://hellgatenyc.com/incredible-homestyle-jamaican-food-yaadman-thing-flatbush-review,3901 Church Avenue,Yaadman Thing (https://www.instagram.com/yaadman.thing/?hl=en),"3901+Church+Avenue,+NYC",Yaadman Thing,40.6521242,-73.9408156,https://www.instagram.com/yaadman.thing/?hl=en,,,,"Jhenell Nelson was born and raised in Jamaica, in the parish of Portland. When she moved to Brooklyn four years ago, she brought with her a partner—namely, her husband Kemar—and everything her grandmother ever taught her back home about cooking: an array of Jamaican classics like jerk chicken, curry goat, and callaloo. The couple spent their first few years manning sidewalk grills at various Church Avenue corners (Church and Bedford, Church and Rogers, Church and Albany), and built up enough of a local following that at the end of 2021, the Nelsons opened their first ever restaurant, Yaadman Thing, on Church and 39th Street. Outside of Yaadman Thing. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""If you're from Jamaica, and you're real about it, you're called a yaadman,"" Jhenell told Hell Gate. ""And since everything in here is authentic, we call it a Yaadman Thing."" Yaadman Thing is a modest space. ""Dining in,"" for instance, means grabbing one of only two stools at the counter in the front window; the side windows were bricked over years ago; and, other than a fresh paint job, there's little to distinguish it aesthetically from any of the dozens of other jerk joints in this part of town. Ah, but last week, I got a tip about Yaadman from my boss's mom at my other job, who told me that the jerk here is the best in Brooklyn. Sold! One 5 train ride from the city later (there's a Citi Bike dock right on Church and 38th too, which I used to get home to Bushwick), and I was scarfing down an enormous serving of fatty, juicy, heavily seasoned, wonderfully saucy, hacked-up pig. Medium-sized jerk pork dinner with rice and peas and cabbage, $13. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Seriously, this is some excellent jerk. There's also jerk chicken here, of course, as well as jerk ribs, jerk shrimp, and—for you $45 Dinner ballers out there—jerk lobster. Jhenell said that they're in the process of producing a line of Yaadman Thing jerk sauce, and I would have definitely brought a bottle home if they'd been ready. The jerk combo meal comes in three sizes—my $13 ""medium"" weighed like five pounds—and comes with white rice or rice and peas, plus a side dish like coleslaw, macaroni salad, or steamed cabbage. It's all great stuff, and super filling. Even better, though, is Jhenell's curry goat, my go-to at Jamaican spots and, here at Yaadman, maybe the best I've ever had. The meat was tender and funky, the sauce delivered a good amount of fire, and it made a perfect companion for my side of gooey, crusty mac and cheese. Small-sized portion of curry goat, $11, with mac and cheese, $4. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) With these portions, you don't need any extras, but the festivals, a deep-fried sweet dumpling, are so good—freshly fried, slightly crisp, and just the right amount of sweet—that it's a pleasure to overindulge. My Yaadman list for my next visit includes oxtail, doubles, whatever soup Jhenell's got going on (apparently she does a goat's head on the weekend), and maybe the roast conch. Festivals, three for $2. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) It all vibes very homemade, like if you were invited to a barbecue or something at the Nelsons' house. ""This is my kitchen,"" Jhenell said. ""We use natural herbs and spices, we cook on the grill, and we keep it Jamaican."" In other words, it's absolutely a Yaadman Thing. Yaadman Thing is located at 3901 Church Avenue, at the corner of 39th Street, and is open Monday through Thursday from 7 a.m. (have some ackee and saltfish for breakfast!) to 9 p.m., on Friday and Saturday to 10 p.m., and on Sunday from 8 a.m to 7 p.m. (347-365-3315) Co-owner and chef Jhenell Nelson helps a customer.

"A Love Letter to Doaba Deli, a Homey Community Hub",https://hellgatenyc.com/a-love-letter-to-doaba-deli-a-homey-community-hub,945 Columbus Avenue,Punjabi Deli (https://gothamist.com/food/checking-recently-reopened-punjabi-east-village-),"945+Columbus+Avenue,+NYC",Punjabi Deli,40.7994092,-73.9624171,https://gothamist.com/food/checking-recently-reopened-punjabi-east-village-,,,,"In a perfect world, there would be hundreds of places like Doaba Deli all over the city. I'm talking simple, welcoming spots where you could stop in for a plate of cheap, perfectly good food, something warm to drink, and a bit of fellowship—no drama, no frills, and no-questions-asked access to a reasonably clean bathroom. Actually, in a perfect perfect world, such places would be funded and operated in a loving and non-corrupt manner by the City itself, as a necessary public service. But until that day comes, at least we have people like Inderjit Singh, who opened Doaba Deli almost 15 years ago and has been feeding people from all walks of life—though Columbia students and cabbies seem to make up the bulk of his clientele—ever since. Your menu is whatever you see at the steam table. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Does 15 years sound like not that long ago? Maybe, but the place feels like it's been here much longer than that. Other than the freshly painted, alarmingly green walls, Doaba Deli has a very lived-in vibe, with battered tables, faded signage, and a single, smeary menu whose prices have been updated by hand over the years. Thankfully, those prices have not gone up by much. The standard order here is a choice of three (usually vegetarian) dishes served with either rice or roti. It used to be $7, and now it's $10. Samosas are $1.50 extra. And really, ignore the menu. Whatever's set out in the steam table is what's available. Three dishes (dal, spinach, and squash) and rice, $10. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Three dishes (cabbage patta gobi, chickpeas, red bean radima) and roti, $10; the samosas are $1.50 each. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) When we went on a recent Saturday night, that included some decent yellow daal, a good spinach and mustard saag, a sweet squash dish that we liked a lot, and some chunky cabbage patta gobi. The white rice and freshly warmed roti were both fine, and the samosas were great. Several of our fellow patrons popped in just to wolf a pair of these latter savory pastries with a cup of chai. Everything can be given a zippy boost from the pickled achaar that sits at each table, which I suggest you spoon on with abandon. Enjoying the fare, handmade or not. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Despite signs boasting that Doaba serves ""America's finest handmade paratha,"" and, additionally, that this is the ""paratha capital of New York City,"" that particular style of flatbread was unavailable when we went. In fact, evidence—via unconcealed storage areas in the clearly visible kitchen—suggests that these days Doaba Deli is mostly heating up (or, in the case of our mango lassi, pouring out) institutional fare from bulk-sized containers rather than making stuff from scratch. That's not what I remember from years ago, but also, it's fine? Food-wise, Punjabi Deli in the East Village remains the gold standard among the city's South Asian steam table spots, but Doaba gets the job done too, and provides an important resource in a neighborhood that often treats the workers it relies upon (for food delivery , or ride share services) with disdain. Doaba Deli is located at 945 Columbus Avenue, between 106th and 107th Streets, and is currently open from 10:00 a.m. to midnight daily. Already a user? Log in Thanks for reading!

The excellent ""late night chicken sandwich,"" for example (which, don't worry, is available all day), is a fiery beast of meal, a squishy bun unable to contain the pile of impossibly juicy, crackling-fried thigh meat, which is slathered in garlic sauce and Nassif's housemade piri piri, then topped with fresh parsley and both pickled red cabbage and just regular pickles for a double-hit of acid. It's also halal. And has the name of the place branded on its bun. And it's delicious. A Hen House must. But maybe Nassif's authentic Lebanese and Egyptian dishes, conjured from childhood memories and his grandmother's recipes, should be considered signature Hen House fare? Nassif calls the Molokheya here ""my most favorite thing on the planet,"" and after wolfing a bowl the other day I can see where he's coming from--this thick, lemony, parsley-rich Egyptian chicken soup, spooned over rice and blanketed in pickled onions, is a deeply satisfying cold-weather dish. ""I grew up eating this at my grandmother's house,"" he told Hell Gate. ""It's super nostalgic for me."" Molokheya, $13. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Other Nassif nostalgia bombs include the ""childhood crispy kafta rice,"" which I hear is amazing, and, really, all of the pitas, which he stuffs with abandon and rolls up tight.

The pomegranate molasses is important here, but he was also raised in Montreal, so there's a ""fully loaded"" (e.g., with French fries) versions of everything too.

Hen House NYC is located at 120 First Avenue, between St. Marks Place and Seventh Street, and is currently open from Tuesday through Thursday from 12:00 noon to 10:00 p.m., on Friday and Saturday from noon to 2:00 a.m., and on Sunday from noon to 8:00 p.m. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) It's easier to figure out the signature dishes at Kolachi, which opened last November just a few doors up from Hen House, because there's literally only three things on the menu. Operated by Saif Qazi and Kiran Lutfeali, partners in business and life as the saying goes, Kolachi specializes in the sort of paratha rolls that, according to Qazi, are everywhere in his native Karachi--""it's like our cheeseburgers, or slices of pizza"" he said--but, to the couple's dismay, were impossible to find here in New York City. Chicken and beef paratha rolls, $6.50 each. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The Kolachi rolls are about the size of a big spliff or fat cigar, and contain a single skewers-worth of flame-grilled beef or chicken, enough onion to get your attention, and, key ingredient, a ton of tangy, funky mint yogurt chutney sauce. Maybe I liked the chicken one better? It had a little more kick than the beef. Both, though, really hit the spot. You definitely want to get the fries here, too, which are well-seasoned and just the right amount of fluffy. They're called ""diesel fries,"" but not because they use diesel oil to cook them. Qazi explains: ""In Karachi kids sell fries from carts, and they have these home electric fryers which they power with diesel generators. So when you walk up to the cart you smell the diesel immediately. So folks just started calling them diesel fries."" Diesel fries with maple syrup, $4.50. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Major plot twist, every order of fries is served with a little crock of maple syrup for dipping, a condiment I don't think I've ever seen handed over in this context without explanation. ""It's a little bit inspired by Karachi ketchup,"" Qafi said. ""These kids sell this ketchup that no New Yorker would ever call ketchup. It is sweet and it is bright red. But also, my wife [Lutfeali] always likes to mix sweet with savory, so she thinks it's good."" And she's correct. It rules.

""It's a little bit inspired by Karachi ketchup,"" Qafi said. ""These kids sell this ketchup that no New Yorker would ever call ketchup. It is sweet and it is bright red. But also, my wife [Lutfeali] always likes to mix sweet with savory, so she thinks it's good."" And she's correct. It rules. Kolachi is located at 130 First Avenue, between St. Marks Place and Seventh Street, and is currently open on Monday through Friday from 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight, and on Saturday and Sunday from 11:00 a.m. to midnight.

"The Best Bar Food in NYC Is at Lori Jayne, Deep in the Heart of a Bushwick Music Venue",https://hellgatenyc.com/bushwick-nyc-lori-jayne-alphaville-comfort-food,140 Wilson Avenue,"Righteous Eats (https://www.instagram.com/p/C2VK5uIphR2/), Lori Jayne (https://www.instagram.com/lorijaynebk/?hl=en)","140+Wilson+Avenue,+NYC",Righteous Eats,40.7005387,-73.9258218,https://www.instagram.com/p/C2VK5uIphR2/,,,,"Sam Braverman opened his restaurant Lori Jayne inside the Brooklyn venue Alphaville almost a year ago, but even before then he was extremely familiar with the space. In addition to being a rock-n-roll, Bushwick-vibing bar, Alphaville also functions as a full concert space, and Braverman used to get on stage there with with a whole bunch of different bands. The rock star thing didn't work out, so Braverman shifted his attention to food, and cooking, to earn a living, doing popups and consulting under the name SILTE, or Shit I Like To Eat, and selling wings out of his apartment during the early pandemic. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Enter Alphaville (again), whose owners were looking for someone to run their kitchen after they renovated the place in 2022. Braverman counter-offered with his Lori Jayne concept—basically, he uses the bar's infrastructure for his own unique restaurant--and is now serving a full menu of outstanding comfort food to the often quite rowdy Alphaville crowd. Let's start with the burger, which the folks at Righteous Eats recently put on the social-media map. Eschewing the smashburger trend, Braverman and his crew deliver a quarter-pound beauty, topped with bone-broth caramelized onions (like everything here, even the smallest touches are made with a little bit of extra love), thick pickle slices, melted American cheese for an extra buck if you're feeling flush, and a slathering of Lori Jayne sauce, which Braverman describes as ""if In-n-Out spread hung out with a Cajun remoulade."" This is old-school burger perfection. Buffalo 2.0 wings, 7 for $14 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) You'll definitely want a side of hand cut fries, too—they're crisp and salty (and vegan) and come with Braverman's house made curry ketchup, which he reverse engineered from his memories of going to the old East Village Pomme Frites as a kid. ""That was the bomb,"" he said, correctly. But maybe Braverman's also-vegan fried 'shrooms are even better? Order these and you get a mountain of oyster mushrooms, battered with tapioca starch and rice flour and covered in Lori Jayne's Sichuan spice blend. The chicken nuggets are breaded and fried to order, and they're big flavored and admirably tender. For these I recommend Braverman's sinus-clearing horseradish honey mustard sauce, a recipe inspired by his life partner Inna Mkrtycheva's Armenian grandmother, who always has a strange little bottle of a similar condiment in her fridge. ""We just call it grandma mustard,"" he said. ""It's full of horseradish and spicy as hell."" Chicken nuggets, 5 for $6 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) My favorite thing here, however, was probably the gloriously gloppy ""Buffalo 2.0"" wings, the bird twice-fried for extra crispiness and drenched in a Crystal hot sauce with chunks of blue cheese. There are frequent daily specials, like a chicken sandwich that Braverman described as being ""like Chick-fil-A but I made it EXTRA GAY,"" and the lobster thermidor gyoza they were slinging on New Year's Eve, and, sometimes, dessert, like the excellent slice of key lime pie I had last Friday, which was homebaked by Mkrtycheva. Lori Jayne is totally Braverman's creation, but he's quick and eager to give credit to his cooking crew. ""We have a really strong punk rock brigade of guys who have experience in a range of restaurants,"" he said. ""Jeff Lewis is a Mainer hippie, used to be at Llama San, still at Saraghina half the week, plays the mandolin, and we use the garlic from his brother's farm. We call Ryan Maggio Colonel Crispy Buns because he makes the best buns. And Tim Robinson, who goes by Tuna, also works at Lalou and is the most line cook line cook who's ever line cooked."" Key lime pie, $5 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Lori Jayne, by the way, is named for Braverman's mom, who taught him how to fry chicken. When I asked if she had ever been out here to Bushwick he looked at me in disbelief. ""She's a Jewish mom from New York,"" he said. ""She's come a million times. In fact she's coming tomorrow with my dad and eight of their friends from high school to have a birthday dinner."" There's lots of seating at Alphaville--at the bar, obviously, but also at a row of elevated tables in the big main room and in heavily-scarred wooden booths in a kind of side room. It can get super loud and crowded as the night wears on and the bands start playing and everyone gets drunk, but it's pretty chill around dinner time if you just want to sip a couple of beers and grab a bite with friends. ""This has been everything to me,"" said Braverman about running Lori Jayne. ""It's been the most exhausting and spiritually fulfilling experience of my life. It's just really cool to do what you're supposed to do, with a team of people who are equally excited about it, and growing as individuals and cooks while we're doing it. It's the best."" Lori Jayne is located inside Alphaville at 140 Wilson Avenue, between Suydam Street and Willoughby Avenue, and is currently open on Sunday through Wednesday from 6:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight, and on Thursday through Saturday from 6:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. Already a user?

Delight in the DIY Charm of Greenpoint’s Little Armenia Cafe,https://hellgatenyc.com/greenpoint-new-little-armenia-cafe,1035 Manhattan Avenue,Little Armenia (https://example.com/little-armenia),"1035+Manhattan+Avenue,+NYC",Little Armenia,40.7341789,-73.955158,https://example.com/little-armenia,,,,"There's a definite throwback vibe to Little Armenia Cafe, a highly personal, deeply eccentric new restaurant that opened last week near the north end of Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint. Not that chef and owner Ararat El Rawi is really going for that old-school style that spots like S&P Lunch and Superiority Burger have embraced to excellent effect in recent years, though like those two beauties the bones (and booths) of Little Armenia come from its previous tenant, the long-running Greenpoint Diner. Eating dinner at Little Armenia harkens back to North Brooklyn's fabled DIY culture of the aught years, those no-rules days that gave us legendary music venues like Death by Audio ( RIP ), 285 Kent ( RIP ), and Secret Project Robot in the basement of Monster Island ( RIP ). True, the only music you might hear at Little Armenia is an ancient Grateful Dead show blasted from a tinny Bluetooth speaker, but still, the spirit is there. Chef and owner Ararat El Rawi, in shorts, explaining the menu (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) El Rawi, whose last official restaurant job was as a waiter at Esca, and who made a bit of a name for himself throwing early pandemic pop-ups on the sidewalks of Bed-Stuy, does absolutely everything at Little Armenia, from the decor, to the menu design, to the cooking, to the serving. The lack of polish here—and the relentless force of El Rawi's personality—is refreshing. Just don't expect things like fixed hours. Or signage. Or heat. The menu is unpredictable, a handwritten, photocopied document that El Rawi will also walk you through verbally, and may or may not reflect what you'll be eating that night. We thought we were ordering our dinner in à la carte fashion, for example, but it turned out to be more of a $25 tasting menu type deal. And sometimes El Rawi will just bring you out something random—a shrimp corn dog, say—because he feels like it and has the stuff in the back. Shrimp corn dog (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Other things that hit the table the night we went: a decent bowl of tabouli; shrimp and crab ceviche blended into a vegetable mash and served with Tostito Scoops; salmon roulade swimming in what El Rawi called gazpacho; and an Armenian plate with hunks of various grilled meats, a bit of rice, and grape leaves. For dessert we got two triangles of baklava and a bird's nest. El Rawi seems to prepare most everything during the day, then heats it up for your dinner. Tabouli (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Shrimp ceviche with vegetable purée and Tostito scoops (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""My Armenian dishes are strictly my family's dishes,"" El Rawi told Hell Gate. ""People are going to say, 'Well, the tabouli should be like this' or whatever, but this is what I know. My parents were Armenian immigrants who escaped the genocide and grew up in Iraq, and then years later moved to Minnesota. So this is the food we made in my family, and this is what I'm making for you."" Baklava and bird's nest (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) What he also made for us is this incredible dining room which, although cold enough to keep your coat on during last week's frigid weather, is nonetheless a charmer. El Rawi has lived a life and a half, and he's got the memorabilia to show for it, from his years spent in ""the bubble of Paisley Park"" as the driver for Prince's drummer Michael Bland, to his boxing days (""I used to be pretty,"" he said, ""until they punched my face.""), to the time he met Miles Davis, a story he tells with a dead-on impersonation of the raspy jazz genius. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) El Rawi's passion for pop culture, from the Simpsons to the Ramones, is also very much in evidence. The incongruously fastidious (and unnecessarily numerous) tableware will either delight or make you feel claustrophobic, depending on your feeling about elbow room. And the fresh coats of paint, decking the place out in Armenian yellow, blue, and red, bring new life to what is, undeniably, a battered old room. ""I wanted to open in Bed-Stuy but the rents were way too high,"" El Rawi said. ""It's tough to run a restaurant! When I walked into this place in Greenpoint there were holes in the ceiling, and all this exposed pipe, and my friend said, 'What do you think?' And I said, 'It's a Charlie Brown Christmas.' They brought that wonky little tree, put a blanket underneath it, gave it some love and it became beautiful. This place is the same thing."" Little Armenia Cafe is located at 1035 Manhattan Avenue, between Green and Freeman Streets. Hours vary, but when we went last Friday he opened at 6:15 p.m. for dinner.

It’s a Pizza Party on Canal Street With Lucia and LTD,https://hellgatenyc.com/pizza-party-on-canal-street-with-lucia-and-ltd,375 Canal Street,Lucia Pizza (https://example.com/lucia-pizza),"375+Canal+Street,+NYC",Lucia Pizza,40.7214043,-74.0043748,https://example.com/lucia-pizza,,,,"Canal Street is known for many things: sidewalks clogged with tourists, hawkers luring you in with fake luxury goods, angry drivers honking their way from bridge to tunnel, industrial plastic shops where my buddy Wally once bought a six-foot piece of tubing to make a bong back in ninth grade. Pizza, though? One of the basically official foods of NYC? Not so much. Until 2023 that is, when two different slice shops opened on (or adjacent to) the thoroughfare, one of which, the Brooklyn import Lucia Pizza, serves some of the absolute best pizza anywhere in the city. Come by and pick up your pie. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Last November, on SoHo's southern border, Sal Carlino opened his second Lucia Pizza—the first, on Avenue X in Sheepshead Bay, is both a local favorite and a destination joint, thanks in part to a New York Times rave in 2022—and it's pretty much the perfect NYC slice shop. The place is hopping at all hours of the day and night (during the winter it stays open as late as 1 a.m.), with fresh pies hitting the display case nonstop. There's space for about six people to wolf down a slice or two at a narrow standing counter by the front window. An autographed photo of Tony Danza greets you by the register, and if your counter person is Lucia Pizza of SoHo's working partner Richie Quarto, you are in for some patented South Brooklyn friendly-but-no-bullshit hospitality. Richie Quarto back there feeding the Soho crowds. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Quarto described Lucia's pizza to Hell Gate as ""classic New York style with a little modern twist. Nothing too crazy though."" The baseline margherita, with a thin, charred crust covered in bright tomato sauce and fresh, melted mozzarella, is fantastic; a textbook contemporary NYC slice. Rather than get a traditional pepperoni slice, I went with the caramelle piccanti, which adds pickled cherry peppers and Mike's Hot Honey to the grease-puddling 'roni cups on top. It was amazing, all funk and fire, salty and sweet. Lucia's creamed spinach slice, $5.50. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The new creamed spinach slice has become something of a signature at Lucia Pizza of SoHo, inspired, said Quarto, by the legendary side dish at Peter Luger's. This pizza ventures slightly into ""eating dip for dinner"" territory, but in the best possible way. Mushrooms, anchovies, and sausage are among your other topping choices. There are also sandwiches sometimes, and a Caesar salad as well. And even though the place has only been open for a few months, there's a lot of history here. Carlino's parents ran Papa Leone Pizzeria in Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, for some 40 years before retiring in 2018, and Lucia uses the same vodka pie recipe passed down from mom and dad. All special slices are $5.50, which almost feels like a bargain these days. In fact, Carlino only got wind of this busy corner spot in SoHo because the landlord grew up eating his parent's pizza and offered him the keys after Bank of America left the location. (Obviously a huge upgrade for the neighborhood.) And coming in March, right next door on West Broadway: a sit-down cafe called Lucia Alimentari, where Carlino and Quarto will serve small plates, pizza, some pastas, and booze. When I asked Quarto how it felt for a couple of South Brooklyn kids to be setting up shop in tony SoHo, he shook his head and said: ""It's amazing. I remember coming here as a kid. Scrapyard [a graffiti supply shop, if you will] has been here for almost 30 years, so I've been familiar with the area for a long time. It's beautiful to be embraced not only by SoHo but Tribeca as well. It's a blessing, man."" Lucia Pizza of SoHo is located at 375 Canal Street, at the corner of West Broadway, and is currently open on Monday through Wednesday from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Thursday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 1 a.m., and Sunday from noon to 10 p.m. LTD is an oasis of pizza across from the entrance to the Holland Tunnel. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) LTD Pizza and Bar, which opened almost a year ago in the neighborhood they're calling Hudson Square, sits just three blocks west from Lucia, but the vibes over here couldn't be more different than the cheer and bustle you find on West Broadway. Having to cross multiple lanes of Tunnel-bound, red-light-running drivers will do that to a place. But as harrowing as the journey over here can be, NYC pizza completists should definitely check out LTD. For one thing, once inside, the place is pleasant and bright and, unlike Lucia, there's plenty of seating, plus wine and beer. True, the back dining room is a little weird, but you don't have to hang out there. More important, LTD sells a delicious, fairly unusual square slice, which co-owner Dennis Arakelian called ""a combination of Detroit and New York Sicilian styles."" The LTD vodka pesto square slice, $6. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) I had the vodka pesto square slice, and it was terrific. Thinner than either of its inspirations, it uses the same dough as LTD's regular slices, but it's blasted for longer in the oven so the base and sides get super crisp. And the crunchy crust is countered by extra sauce and sliced mozzarella on top, which gives the whole thing a welcome gloppiness. Very cool contrast. LTD's ""pork store"" ($6) and margherita ($5) slices. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There's also ""church pie"" square slices available—no cheese, just tomatoes—which Arakelian said ""was kind of a classic in Central Jersey and Brooklyn about 20 years ago.""

Excellent Malaysian Fare on Historic Doyers Street,https://hellgatenyc.com/doyers-street-malaysian-doyers-old-town-review,15 Doyers Street,Doyers Old Town (https://www.doyersoldtown.com/),"15+Doyers+Street,+NYC",Doyers Old Town,40.7145924448806,-73.9982335928011,https://www.mocanyc.org/collections/stories/doyers-street/,,,,"Who doesn't love Doyers Street? It's got a killer nickname, the Bloody Angle , because of all the murder that took place in the early 1900s when old-timey tongs or secret society members jumped out to attack their foes from around the sharp corner that defines the street. It's got a lot of good places to eat, including Chinatown's oldest restaurant, Nom Wah Tea Parlor. Most of the time there are no cars allowed here anymore, so tables and chairs can be set out every morning for your dining and relaxing pleasure. Tourists and locals flock to the spot—and that's great! But the crowds also make it hard to just pull up and grab a meal at mainstays like Nom Wah, Taiwanese Pork Chop House, Tasty Hand Pulled Noodles, or the Hong Kong Mabu Cafe without waiting on some sort of line. Enter the new Doyers Old Town, a nifty little Malaysian coffee shop that opened last November in the former China Beauty hair salon space and is currently serving some first-rate food suitable for breakfast, lunch, snack time, and dinner. A Malaysian coffee shop lurks behind the Nom Wah line. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) When I went—during prime Saturday brunch time—last weekend there was no wait, and plenty of empty tables inside. An underrated quality in a restaurant! Nasi lemak, $12 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The Doyers Old Town menu seems to be a bit unfixed, depending whether you look at it online or in person, but there are some constants. The nasi lemak, for example, is set in stone, which is unsurprising since it's the national dish of Malaysia. The kitchen cranks out a stellar version here, starring plenty of ikan bilis (those peanuts and tiny fried anchovies), a big glob of funky sambal sauce, a hard-boiled egg, crisp cucumbers, and an generous amount of sweet, snappy shrimp, all piled atop a mound of sticky coconut rice, with the bonus of some decent chicken curry on the side. Hakka pan mee, $12.95 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Also delicious is the hakka pan mee, a big bowl of clear, anchovy-infused broth thick with wide flour noodles, various fungi, ground pork, and lots more of those chewy little fried anchovies. Definitely dump in the crock of chili oil that comes with it, and maybe even ask for a second shot. This is an invigorating meal. There are other hefty dishes you can eat here, several of which involve the chicken curry, and a bunch of snackier things like chicken satay, skewered shu mai, and tofu with sambal. But what you're going to want to get, to split with a buddy for dessert or to wolf down yourself with a cup of hot, sweet Malaysian pulled tea, is the kaya toast, a slab of soft shokupan bread toasted until golden and slathered with coconut jam and butter. Golden kaya butter toast, $6, with a cup of sweet teh tarok, $4.50. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The space itself is weirdly dramatic, with a ceiling that evokes a kind of underground grotto and a water feature by the front door that burbles away throughout your meal. Still, the counter person is warm and friendly, not at all like a cave dweller, and your food comes out in a hurry. You can even bring it all outside to one of the tables on Doyers if the weather's pleasant and the lines for its neighboring eateries haven't completely taken over the street. Huh! (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There's a water feature here for your enjoyment. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The owners of Doyers Old Town weren't available for an interview, but know that they have been busy. In addition to this cafe, the team also just opened Happy Malaysian Canteen over at 76 Mott Street, which is more basic looking (though the sky ceiling is cute) and features more vegetarian dishes. Doyers Old Town is located at 15 Doyers Street, on the Pell Street-adjacent stretch of the Bloody Angle, and is currently open from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. daily. Already a user?

Where to Find the Best Beach Food at Rockaway This Endless Summer,https://hellgatenyc.com/rockaway-beach-food-guide-2024,108 and Rockaway Beach Drive,"Boardwalk Bagel (https://www.instagram.com/boardwalkbagel/?hl=en), La Cevicheria (https://www.instagram.com/lacevicheriany/?hl=en), Tacoway Beach (https://www.instagram.com/tacowaybeach/?hl=en)","108+and+Rockaway+Beach+Drive,+NYC",Boardwalk Bagel,40.5813475,-73.829771,https://www.instagram.com/boardwalkbagel/?hl=en,,,,"In the '90s, I was fortunate enough to spend several summers at share houses in Montauk, riding those bouncy old diesel trains out to Ditch on alternate weekends or whatever the schedule was. It was a glorious time, a years-long narrative arc that took me from drug-addled debauchery to the more enduring joys of hanging with my two then-tiny daughters. It didn't last, of course, as Montauk in the 21st century joined the rest of the Hamptons in the ""are you serious with this shit?"" price range—when I couldn't even afford a weekend at the East Deck anymore, I knew it was over for real—but that doesn't mean I quit sunburns and sand. For the last 18 years or so, my ""summer house"" has been the extremely free beaches of Rockaway. Specifically, the stretch from Beach 86 to Beach 108, with my exact landing spot determined mostly by what I feel like eating that day. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Getting out to Rockaway is cheap and easy via public transportation. Yes, the ferry ride from Pier 11 in Manhattan affords you some pleasant breezes and Brooklyn shoreline views, but there's always something deeply satisfying to me about getting on the A at, say, Utica Avenue and emerging on the shores of the Atlantic freaking Ocean. And though there have been a couple of posh newcomers to the scene recently (looking at you, Rockaway Hotel and Spa and your $75 half-day pool admission), for the most part the neighborhood retains its somewhat ragged, all-are-welcome charm. What really seals the deal about Rockaway though, and why I'll make the trip out here about once a week from now through Labor Day, are the many excellent eating options, most owned and operated by Rockaway locals, that have been around for years. Below are my favorites. The more seasoned Rockaway heads among you will likely have already been to them all, but it's the increasingly consistent landscape out here which brings that vacation-home vibe to the place. Year after year, Rockaway feels the same, as if it's all part of one long, glorious summer. There will be a lot more people here this weekend. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Last Saturday I hit the beach for some pre-season action. The A train wasn't running, so I took the ferry to Beach 108. As you would expect on a cloudy, intermittently rainy day in May, crowds were sparse—but, per usual, the food was great. My first stop was the OG of the OGs, Boardwalk Bagel on Beach 108 and Rockaway Beach Drive, where Jackie and Danny Foster have been holding it down since 2004. The menu here sprawls like any self-respecting NYC deli, with dozens of different bagels, sandwiches, and wraps, as well as things such as breakfast burritos, burgers, and random entrées. Stick to the basics—my ""Shark Attack"" hero was loaded with sausage, bacon, ham, eggs, home fries, and cheese, and it was awesome—and you will walk away full and happy. Hey, what are you guys getting? (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The Shark Attack hero (eggs, cheese, bacon, ham, sausage, home fries) from Boardwalk Bagel, $10.95 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Surfers have taken to the waves off Beach 106, so the big boardwalk concession stand here was hopping. One of my favorite places to eat breakfast (ever, in my life ) is at Brothers , which Matt Webster, Sarah Peltier, and an ace crew of their close friends have been running for nine years now. The smoothies here are all exceptional—this is literally the only place I ever drink a smoothie. Peltier's pastries will buckle your knees, the English muffin egg sandwich with pesto hits the spot every time, and the kimchi grilled cheese, with optional runny egg, will wake you right the hell up. Plus the vibes, and Webster's playlist, are impeccable. A small crowd outside of Brothers. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Kimchi grilled cheese, with optional egg, from Brothers, $12 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Also at the Beach 106 concession is Maribel Araujo's venerable Caracas Arepa Bar , heading into its 14th season on the boardwalk. Or, as Araujo put it, ""I'm setting up my circus again."" The jaw-stretching arepa sandwiches are the thing to get here; I'm partial to the one overstuffed with beef, black beans, cheese, and sweet plantains, which makes for a delicious, and extremely complete, meal, but there are plenty of other good things too, like the empanadas, the Venezuelan cheese sticks, and, I guess, the beer. Araujo's also introducing bowls this year, and a new vegan arepa. This is the last Caracas standing (Araujo shut down her Williamsburg and East Village locations during the early pandemic) so if nothing else, you should come and pay your respects to the legend. Arepa de pabellón (beef, black beans, cheese, plantains) from Caracas Arepa Bar, $15 The Beach 97 concession stand is the biggest and, on high-season weekends, the most chaotic spot on the boardwalk, with some 70 free concerts planned for this summer, plus weekly lobster boils, plenty of booze, and 10 different food vendors inside the sprawling space. My two go-tos here are Sean Aiken's superb ""sturdy Neapolitan"" pizzas at Seany (prior to opening four years ago, Aiken worked the ovens at Paulie Gee's and Speedy Romeo), and Leyla & Ximena Yrala's lovely Peruvian seafood at La Cevicheria . The Yralas have been at Beach 97 for 11 years now, and their tart, briny, generously portioned ceviche bowls are always pure pleasure. Pepperoni pie from Seany Pizza, $17 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Meat pelmeni from Uma's, $17 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Going inland for a minute, the once-vibrant corner of Beach 96 and Rockaway Beach Boulevard today sits empty, decrepit, and forlorn, but Uma's Uzbek over on Beach 92 and RBB is still serving one of my favorite dishes in town, an incredible plate of pelmeni, a dozen or so handmade Russian dumplings stuffed with well-seasoned ground beef and lamb and topped with red onion sauce, dill, cilantro, and yogurt sauce. The interior of Uma's doesn't exactly scream ""beach day"" (there's a surfboard on the wall, but it's mostly just dim and sleepy in here), so unless you need a break from the sun you may want to get your order to go and wolf it on the boardwalk. Blueberry yuzu sticky bun from Rockaway Bakery, $6 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) You have three stellar options right off the Beach 90 stop on the shuttle train. Tracy Obolsky's Rockaway Beach Bakery , on Rockaway Beach Boulevard at Beach 98, is one of NYC's absolute best pastry shops, with a stunning array of laminated stuff (the yuzo blueberry sticky bun last Saturday was phenomenal), plus pies, pound cakes, scones, cookies, sandwiches, and, if you get lucky, her homemade ice cream. Obolsky worked pastry at several acclaimed restaurants, including Cookshop and North End Grill, before opening her own place out here seven years ago, and there would be lines down the block if this place was in, say, Greenpoint. The Beach 86 boardwalk concession has exactly one tenant, and it's a banger. Rippers , a hamburger joint that opened 14 years ago from the Roberta's and Meat Hook crew also functions as a bar, a cool-kid hangout, and, basically, a total party. The tight menu is all winners. The double-patty ""hardbody"" is the pro move, but the single Rippers burger, pictured, with pickles, lettuce, tomato, and a nice gloppy sauce, is plenty filling as well. The music is rowdy, and sitting here vibing and sharing a huge pile of fries with your (secret?) summer crush is pretty much total heaven. Rippers burger, $11, with fries, $6, at Rippers (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) One fish taco, one chorizo taco, from Tacoway Beach, $12.40 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Speaking of bliss: the fish tacos, and the chorizo tacos, and the new carnitas tacos at the Rockaway granddaddy of them all, Tacoway Beach on Beach 87 and Rockaway Parkway, changed the way we think of beach food out here. The most amazing thing is that, even after making hundreds of thousands of tacos over years at the establishment formerly known as Rockaway Taco, which Andrew Field launched 17 years ago, still taste as good as you remember them being back in 2009 or whenever it was you first got here, sitting in that cramped little side yard beneath the broken surfboard at the old place on Beach 96. (And, yes, Field can still be found back there working the fryer.) Soon, Tacoway, soon. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Awesome. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) It feels like you never left. And that, my dudes, is what going back to your favorite beach town, summer after summer, is all about. Already a user? Log in Thanks for reading!

The Chef Behind One of Brooklyn’s Best Restaurants Is Serving Bar Food in Bushwick,https://hellgatenyc.com/falansai-me-tay-co-hart-bar-bushwick,438 Hart Street at the corner of Bushwick Avenue,Me Tay Co (),"438+Hart+Street+at+the+corner+of+Bushwick+Avenue,+NYC",Me Tay Co,40.6947828,-73.9332898,https://example.com/eric-tran-restaurant,,,,"I first ate chef Eric Tran's food right at the start of that first pandemic winter, when he had just opened Falansai in the heart of industrial Bushwick. The restaurant was takeout-only in those early days, and I grabbed my bagged-up feast from him next to the frozen koi pond in the back patio. Over the next two nights (I bought at least two dinners worth of stuff) I fell in love with Tran's duck necks, and his meaty fried rice, and his fish sauce Brussels sprouts. My man can cook . Falansai is still going strong, of course, earning high-falutin NYC acclaim and kudos from the French tire experts at Michelin, as well as a solid following of regular folks looking for a fun night out while wolfing down Tran's big-flavored Mexican-Vietnamese fare. And then, last weekend with almost no advance warning, Tran set up a second spot in the back of Hart Bar, the sprawling, divey music venue on the corner of Bushwick Avenue. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The new concept is called Me Tay Co (which Tran said is how Vietnamese say ""Mexico""), the menu is tight, and the whole thing came together kind of last minute. ""This all happened like eight weeks ago,"" Tran told Hell Gate. ""I met Matt Maichel, the owner of Hart Bar, and he said he's looking for someone to take over the kitchen, and I said that sounds cool. He's cool. We connected well. Good vibes. We did two popups and it worked, so I said let's go for it."" There were four dishes available at Me Tay Co when I went last Friday—""a baseline menu of stoner bar food,"" is how Tran put it—and they were all delicious. A couple of these come directly from the Falansai kitchen, including Tran's signature ""Dad's egg rolls,"" an order of which gets you a pair of funky, crisp-fried tubes stuffed with pork, wood ear mushrooms, and lettuce, with a fish sauce vinaigrette for dipping. Dad's egg rolls, $10. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) I could probably eat at least a dozen of those suckers, but then I wouldn't have room for a slab of Tran's shrimp toast, which is basically a soft hero roll slathered and dusted with a fantastically umami-rich topping. The chicken wings rule too, messy with the same sticky sweet-sour-spicy sauce as the Falansai duck necks. Shrimp toast, $8. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Umami bomb wings, $10. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The only dish that's completely unique to Me Tay Co (so far! Tran has plans for some ""crazy"" stuff in the future) is the bahn mi fries which, surprisingly, are vegetarian for now and are potent and gloppy as hell. ""This is like an ode to the things they do on the West Coast,"" said Tran. ""I don't know, it's just fun."" There are also a couple of paletas available via the great La Newyorkina. Bahn mi fries, $10. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Hart Bar has a large barroom and an even larger covered patio. Cocktails are $12 to $14, beers are all well under ten bucks, a glass of wine is $9. Downstairs is the performance space, and no matter where you are you will hear whatever band/DJ is playing that night (it was some kind of trippy screamo soundscape deal when I was there). The outdoor dining/drinking/smoking area is a ramshackle affair, which Tran intends to take full advantage of soon with an ordering window that opens out onto the sidewalk. Outdoor seating (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""This kitchen can pack a punch,"" said Tran. ""The space is big, the people here are great, and there's music everywhere, which I fucking love. This is what I would want to eat sitting at the bar here."" Yeah dude, me too. Me Tay Co is located within Hart Bar, 438 Hart Street at the corner of Bushwick Avenue, and is currently open on Tuesday through Thursday from 6:00 p.m. to 1:30 a.m., and on Friday and Saturday from 6:00 to 2:00 a.m. Already a user?

Esse Throws a Fun Party—But Its Tacos Fall Flat,https://hellgatenyc.com/esse-tacos-williamsburg,219 Bedford Avenue,Esse Taco (https://www.instagram.com/essetaco/),"219+Bedford+Avenue,+NYC",Esse Taco,40.7164567,-73.9590186,https://www.instagram.com/essetaco/,,,,"If nothing else, Esse Taco knows how to turn a crowd into a party. The spanking new taqueria, which the acclaimed chef Enrique Olvera opened last weekend in Williamsburg, brings a loose, spilling-out-onto-the-streets energy to an otherwise dispiriting stretch of Bedford Avenue, a block away from the Equinox/Apple/Whole Foods buzzkill. Olvera is best known for his luxe restaurant Pujol in Mexico City—home to, among other things, a $95+ taco omakase—and his luxe restaurant Cosme near the Flatiron. He and his Casamata hospitality group also run the more casual (though also still pretty luxe) spot ATLA, catering to the fit folks of Noho. Pick a barrel, any barrel. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) But as Gonzalo Gout, Casamata's Director of DNA and Culture, told Hell Gate, Olvera has long wanted to open a straight-up taco stand. ""In Mexico,"" Gout said, ""everyone eats tacos. It's the most democratic food, like pizza in New York."" So, rather than go with their original expansion plan and open a second ATLA in Brooklyn, team Casamata finally took the taqueria plunge and gave us Esse. Ribeye steak taco, $5.95; oyster mushroom taco, $5.45 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The taqueria sits on the corner of North 5th Street, and enjoys a long frontage along Bedford Avenue which opens up onto the street. The tables are moveable steel barrels, packed close together near the ordering counter inside and on the sidewalk outside. There are no chairs anywhere. You will be sharing your space and, if you're like me, chatting with your neighbors, which creates a nice, free-flowing vibe to the place. It feels exciting. The music's cranking. The staff is friendly and efficient amidst the chaos. And if there are no barrels available after you order, you can hang out in the curbside dining area, which the team ""built"" by lining up a few orange and white plastic barricades. It's a nifty solution that reminded me of that first pandemic summer, when restaurants turned every block into a block party. Esse is a lively and welcome addition to the neighborhood. So much so, in fact, that you almost don't care that tacos are merely... OK. They're fine. They're interesting? Maybe I blew it because I didn't see the big crock of ""muy picante"" salsa at the pickup counter, but there's a serious lack of oomph to almost everything on the menu here. (Full disclosure: I thought the same thing about the food at ATLA .) (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Corn is the default tortilla at Esse, the fresh masa nixtamalized and pressed by hand daily down in the basement, and they are thick and chewy and do their job well. You can turn any taco into a gringa for an extra buck, which swaps in a flour tortilla and adds chihuahua cheese (and with it, some necessary salt). Next time, that will be my move. My favorite of the four tacos was the pork loin slathered in pineapple butter, an Olvera trademark from Pujol that brings a bit of zing to the proceedings. Here's where I tell you that the meat at Esse isn't chopped, as is standard taco-making procedure, but instead laid atop the tortilla in a single, thinly sliced slab. It's a deliberate decision, made ""to put quality front and center"" as the press release says, and it also takes away any of the usual taco gloopiness. Chicken ""poc chuc"" taco, $4.95; the pork loin with pineapple butter taco, $4.95. Note the slabs of meat (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) I honestly don't really remember anything about the ribeye steak taco, or the chicken ""poc chuc"" one. They weren't bad, necessarily. Olvera is using good meat, and the line cooks cranking these little guys out know what they're doing in the kitchen. They just didn't have any presence. My second favorite taco was the smoky, slippery, oyster mushroom one. Skip the wan guacamole (though maybe it'd be better if you remember to spoon in some salsa?), but definitely get dessert, a stellar cornhusk meringue ice cream sundae adapted for the masses from one of Cosme's signature dishes. It's the best thing here by a considerable margin. As a buddy of mine said, ""it was like—finally! Something excellent."" Cornhusk meringue sundae, $6.00. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) You're not going to want to linger at Esse (nor should you...don't you see that long line of people waiting for your barrel?), but you can probably suck down a beverage or two while you wait for your tacos to come out. Margaritas are $13, a michelada will cost you ten bucks, and house-made agua fresca—the hibiscus grapefruit was decent—is $5 a cup. Esse Taco is located at 219 Bedford Avenue, at the corner of North 5th Street, and is currently open on Wednesday through Friday from 5:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., and on Saturday and Sunday from noon to 11:00 p.m. Closed Monday and Tuesday.

"Burmese Bites Brings Their Big, Funky Flavors to Midtown",https://hellgatenyc.com/burmese-bites-midtown-nyc-review,310 East 44th Street,Burmese Bites (https://www.instagram.com/burmesebites/),"310+East+44th+Street,+NYC",Burmese Bites,40.7504739,-73.9702846,https://www.instagram.com/burmesebites/,,,,"Myo Lin Thway and his wife, business partner, and head chef Rebecca Nant began a mission a decade ago to bring the food of their homeland to a broader audience here in their adopted city of New York. At first, the couple set up a tent on the streets of Elmhurst and at church gatherings, before joining the Queens Night Market in 2016 under the name Burmese Bites. Back then—and, to some extent, still today—the star of their show was their keema palata, a Burmese flatbread filled with chicken, onion, and egg that Thway rolls, stuffs, and griddles in theatrical fashion at both their night market stand and at their three-year-old booth at the Queens Center Mall . And just last week, Thway and Nant opened their first Burmese Bites outpost in Manhattan, in the form of a modestly sized booth in an otherwise unremarkable lunch spot called Mona's Kitchen, located a block away from the United Nations. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""My sister works at the UN,"" Thway told Hell Gate, ""and one day, she saw that this place was empty, and talked to the owner to see if he wanted to lease it out. And the owner said, 'Yeah sure why not.'"" She then called Thway and told him about the space. ""I said, 'Yeah, sure, why not, let's give it a try!' So here we are."" Before you get too excited, there's no grill at Mona's for them to use, so there's no keema palata on the Manhattan menu. But definitely still get stoked, because the five dishes they're serving here are all terrific. I spent 16 years in the '80s and '90s eating mid-ass Midtown lunches and, although I gather things have improved a bit, back then, I would have killed for a bowl of Nant's shan kaukswe, a lovely tangle of rice noodles laden with big, funky flavors from minced chicken in tofu paste, fermented mustard greens, and plenty of chili powder. Shan kaukswe, or Burmese rice noodle salad, with chicken meat sauce, $15. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) I would have also needed a nap. The portions at the new Burmese Bites, served in bowls leftover from the previous tenant (some sort of poke spot, it seems) are enormous. Really, if you can restrain yourself from finishing it in one go, you could probably get lunch and dinner out of a single serving. Another epic dish at the new Burmese Bites is Nant's impossibly tender beef curry over white rice, a Manhattan exclusive that Thway told us he wanted to introduce mostly because it pairs really well with balachaung, which he described as a ""stinky fish paste"" beloved in Burma but little seen in New York City. ""It's our kimchi,"" he said. ""If the Japanese can introduce sushi to America, and Koreans can introduce kimchi, why can't I do that with balachaung?"" Why not indeed! It's potent and delicious. Beef Curry with fish balachaung, $15. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There's also a thick udon-style rice noodle salad with chicken and fish sauce, a wheat noodle coconut ramen dish, and the zippy dum pot biryani, which features a huge hunk of saucy chicken over a mound of well-seasoned basmati rice. Everything is halal, and everything costs $15. Dum pot biryani with braised chicken, $15. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Mona's has a bunch of seating scattered around the sprawling space (in addition to Burmese Bites, there's also a burrito bar and a bibimbap stand), but the move here is to snag a table at the pocket park next door and have a picnic. ""A lot of people ask if this Burmese Bites is temporary, but I hope it's going to be here for a long time,"" said Thway. ""If everything goes according to plan, I want to expand somewhere else too. This is just the beginning. My motto is that Burmese food should be known throughout the world."" The Manhattan Burmese Bites is located inside Mona's Kitchen at 310 East 44th Street, between First and Second Avenues, and is currently open on Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Already a user?

"Two West Village Newcomers Bring Fresh, Delicious Energy to the City’s Increasingly Predictable Burger Game",https://hellgatenyc.com/burgerhead-smacking-burger-west-village-nyc-review,51-63 Eighth Avenue,Smacking Burger (https://www.instagram.com/smackingburger/),"51-63+Eighth+Avenue,+NYC",Smacking Burger,40.7390461,-74.0035504,https://www.instagram.com/smackingburger/,,,,"Want to read the freshest, most incisive coverage of New York City? You’re in the right place! Join the 15,000+ New Yorkers who already love our free newsletter, Inbox Hell, sent out every Wednesday and Saturday—click here to sign up today. I'm not sure exactly when the smashburger completely overwhelmed the beef patty-sandwich scene here, except to say that the last two times I did extensive reporting on New York City's best burgers, in 2015 and then in 2018 , none of the 31 various burgers that made those lists could be considered smashed. (Side note: 11 of the restaurants mentioned have since closed.) Today though, the smashburger is everywhere, with several mini-chains and plenty of rando and/or gimmicky spots slinging 'em, and high-profile retro restaurants getting full-length love in places like the New York Times and even this publication . Now, into the fray enters two burger newcomers, one of which eschews the smash completely, and the other of which is located literally inside a gas station. Both are making delicious burgers and sides, and both are well worth seeking out. Burgerhead The last time I hung out with William Djuric, he was feeding me awesome slabs of burek and trays of cevapi at his and his buddy Jason Correa's Balkan street food restaurant, Balkan StrEATs. Sadly, that restaurant has since closed. ""We were a little ahead in this neighborhood for that type of food. There wasn't such a demand,"" Djuric told Hell Gate. An equally difficult challenge? Their master baker from Belgrade, Milan Milijancevic, had visa problems, and without him, half the menu was instantly 86ed. And so the duo rebranded their space on Sixth Avenue and opened Burgerhead, slinging superb charbroiled (not smashed!) burgers, sloppy-ass chili dogs, and super-thick shakes. Burgerhead's Charburger with bacon, $9.90, chili cheese dog, $7.90, and beef fat fries, $4.50. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""I love a flame-grilled burger,"" said Djuric. ""It harkens back to backyard barbecues and even going to Burger King as a kid. So we're doing almost throwback burgers here, like my fantasy version, or perfect memory, of a burger."" You can get your Burgerhead charburger as a double, but the single-patty version works just fine, especially if you add on some bacon. It's meaty and juicy, with a nice balance among the classic toppings (shredded lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles from the Pickle Guys), and a nice mustardy special sauce glopping things up. Bonus points for the good sesame seed bun, which Djuric says is tough to source these days. Burgerhead's vanilla shake, $5.90 (whipped cream and sprinkles are $1 extra). (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The salty, beef-tallow fries are first-rate too, as is the vanilla shake, which they make to order with hard, not soft, ice cream, so it's cheek-suctioning thick. And I loved the Burgerhead chili—a woefully underrepresented dish on New York City menus, in my opinion—which you can eat by the cup or ladled all over a snappy hot dog with tons of cheese. It's all extremely satisfying, and it's all exactly what you want food like this to taste like. Burgerhead is located at 353 Sixth Avenue, between West Washington Place and West Fourth Street, and is currently open on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Sunday from 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m., and Thursday through Saturday from 11:30 a.m. to 1 a.m. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Smacking Burger The last time I hung out with Tommy Hondros, he fed me nothing. To be fair, I didn't show up expecting to eat. Hondros owns the Mobil station on Eighth Avenue and 13th Street, and I was there to take photos for a Curbed story about how he was Lower Manhattan's last gas man standing. This was in 2016 and, as far as i can tell, his gas station remains the only one open below 14th Street. And since I've never owned a car in my life, and haven't even rented one since 2011, there hasn't been any reason for me to return and see Hondros again—until last week, when he and his girlfriend Elizabeth Torres opened a full-fledged restaurant inside the station, complete with seating out front, called Smacking Burger. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""We opened a snacking place here three years ago called Snackies World, with chips, cookies, sodas, but the taxi drivers, the truckers, the firefighters, they all wanted food,"" Torres told Hell Gate. ""My boyfriend loves burgers, and one day, we were testing these out and he said, 'This thing smacks ,' so now we have Smacking Burger. Mr. Smacks""—she pointed to the logo—""is our guy. People are loving it."" The burgers here are technically smashburgers, but they're ""soft smashes,"" so they're still pretty juicy. And unlike some smash spots, Smacking Burger does not skimp on their sauces, which include an excellent housemade horseradish that I dumped all over my double-patty ""Big Smack"" and my terrific ""Oklahoma 2.0,"" the latter of which was exploding with charred onions. Smacking Burger's Big Smack, $8.99, and Oklahoma 2.0, $8.99. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Both these burgers made me very happy, as did the ""World Famous Smacking Fries,"" a mound of crisp spuds topped with a crumbled up burger; melted American cheese; pickles; onion; plenty of orange ""smack sauce;"" and, key ingredient alert, a dab of fiery green chimi, which was also housemade, and also great. Smacking Burger's fries, $7.99. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Get your beverages from the Mobil Mart refrigerator cases (beer and other boozy pleasures are an option) and grab one of the picnic tables set up outside. Yes, you will smell gas while you eat—non-burger customers are filling up their cars a few feet from you—but you also be the envy of all those poor saps who can't sit down and join you, tethered as they are by their two-ton money suckers. Coming soon: a full breakfast menu, and sports (go Knicks!) playing on a bank of flat screens facing the pumps. Smacking Burger is located inside the gas station at 51-63 Eighth Avenue, at the corner of 13th Street, and is currently open on Tuesday through Thursday, and Sunday, from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., and on Friday and Saturday from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Already a user?

There’s No Palestinian Food at This Year’s Queens Night Market. Here’s Where You Should Go Instead,https://hellgatenyc.com/queens-night-market-palestinian-food-astoria,25-53 Steinway Street,"Grub Street (https://www.grubstreet.com/2023/11/what-happens-to-queens-night-market-now.html), Gabriele Perici (https://www.instagram.com/gabrieleperici/)","25-53+Steinway+Street,+NYC",Grub Street,40.7665376,-73.9125684,https://www.grubstreet.com/2023/11/what-happens-to-queens-night-market-now.html,,,,"Tala, the founder of Baba's Olives , was thrilled when she first joined the Queens Night Market in the summer of 2021, setting up her Taste of Palestine tent along with dozens of other vendors in Flushing Meadows Corona Park. ""I was the first and only Palestinian vendor there,"" Tala, who asked to only use her first name for privacy reasons, told Hell Gate this past weekend. ""I've always seen Baba's Olives and Taste of Palestine as a mechanism for food diplomacy—a way to humanize Palestinians, and tell the story of our rootedness to the land. There was a much bigger purpose to being there."" Tala's Taste of Palestine tent on opening night in 2021. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Last fall, however, her tenure at Queens Night Market came to a sudden, disheartening end. On October 28, according to reports from Grub Street and Eater , Tala and her Taste of Palestine team started the night by displaying signs on their booth with a straightforward message: ""Your tax dollars are funding the genocide of Palestinians. End the occupation—Free Palestine."" Queens Night Market officials, who said they had received two complaints from patrons that the signs made them feel ""unsafe,"" asked Tala to remove them. When she refused, security guards tore them down —multiple times. A shaken but defiant Tala gave away the rest of her food for free before she left for the rest of the year. Now, she's refusing to return for this year's night market, which opened for the season last Saturday . ""Ripping down the sign was really the personification of racialized capitalism and cultural appropriation,"" Tala said. ""Especially when it comes to Palestinians, there is a complete lack of recognition and ability to see our humanity, and I have no interest in serving our food without the recognition of our humanity, and of our struggle."" Crowds on opening night in 2021, with the Taste of Palestine tent to the right. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""Where was this food borne out of?"" she continued. ""Who are we as a people? What is our history? What is our struggle? What is our humanity? The sign was meant to get people to think critically. This is a U.S.-subsidized war. This is a U.S.-funded genocide. This moment in time demands and calls all of us to be in touch with our humanity. This moment in time demands that we don't silence Palestinian voices. So it felt like a really inhumane thing to do."" I spoke with Queens Night Market founder John Wang last weekend about last year's incident, and about opening night this year, though most of our conversation was off the record. He did send Hell Gate an official comment: ""Our vendor policies are intended to create a safe, welcoming, and family-friendly environment for the tens of thousands of visitors we see each night. When those policies are broken and that noncompliance results in visitors reporting feeling unsafe, it's an issue we take very seriously."" In solidarity with Tala, several autonomous groups, including Queers for a Liberated Palestine, have called for a boycott of the Queens Night Market this year—and, at least on opening night, I joined them. I admit I struggled with the decision for a minute or two. I've met many, many good people among the vendors there over the years, small business owners who aren't getting rich from slinging, say, $5 bowls of mantu. None of them had anything to do with the incident at Tala's booth last fall. In 2021, Tala served makloubeh, which she described as Palestine's national dish. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) But to go and gorge myself and pretend we don't need to hear from Palestinians, that we can't handle even seeing any sort of anti-war, anti-genocide messaging, wasn't an option. As a U.S. taxpayer, I'm already (extremely unwillingly) paying for these atrocities in Gaza. The least I can do is stand by those who are screaming for them to stop. I did still need to eat some dinner on Saturday night though, so I also asked Tala if she could recommend a few of her favorite places in Queens where I could get good food in an environment where Palestinians voices are most definitely not silenced. Her suggestions, all Astoria mainstays, were excellent, and each fell well within the $20 Dinner parameters. King of Falafel and Shawarma Both Trump and Biden come under fire at the King of Falafel storefront. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Freddy Zeideia is a Queens icon, a native Palestinian whose King of Falafel food trucks and storefront by the elevated train on Broadway have earned him awards (the Vendy in 2010), acclaim ( from me , among countless others), and a deep respect in the community for his unapologetic attitude about his heritage. Falafel platter, $10. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) If you haven't been here in a while, don't worry: The falafel is still as good as ever, the outer layer fried to a crackle. The shawarma also rules, and the mixed-meat pita is a messy monster of a sandwich. What's changed? Zeideia's ""Free Palestine"" messaging, always present, has these days been amped up to levels that are impossible to ignore. Mixed shawarma sandwich, $12.49. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Detail of artist Gabriele Perici's huge Gaza mural. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) You step on the faces of world leaders complicit in the atrocities in Gaza as you walk in (and while you pee). The exterior is festooned with, among other things, anti-Trump and anti-Biden flags and posters calling for an immediate ceasefire. There's an amazing mural by Gabriele Perici inside that takes up the entire wall facing the counter; it depicts the horrors happening in Gaza right now. Saturday night at King of Falafel and Shawarma. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The place was bustling last Saturday, filled with a diverse group of Astorians getting takeout or dining inside, including several families with little kids. No one seemed to feel unsafe. King of Falafel and Shawarma is located at 3015 Broadway, just west of 31st Street, and is currently open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. Zyara Restaurant Outside of Zyara. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Speaking of bustling, the delightful, slightly chaotic Zyara over on Steinway Street was packed on Saturday evening, with big groups filling the tables in the covered back patio and takeout crowds spilling out onto the sidewalk. I waited over half an hour for a seat, but it was well worth it for my lamb adana platter, starring three plump, juicy, well-seasoned meat patties slathered in fiery and garlicky sauces. Zyara's enormous shawarma spits. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Zyara is not, strictly speaking, a Palestinian restaurant—the owner, Feras Alzughier, is from Jordan—but the menu features an array of familiar Middle Eastern delights. That includes pitas and laffa stuffed with shawarma carved from three of the largest rotating spits I've ever seen, and lots of good sides and salads. Alzughier doesn't hide his Palestinian solidarity, with ""Stand With Palestine"" stickers all around and a big donation box smack in the middle of the aisle. This place is a blast. Hardly an empty seat in the house. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Zyara is located at 25-53 Steinway Street, between 28th and 25th Avenues, and is currently open on Monday through Thursday from noon to midnight, and on Friday through Sunday from noon to 1 a.m. Al-Sham Sweets and Pastries Dessert heaven. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) A few blocks up Steinway from Zyara is where you should get dessert, at the cramped but wonderful Al-Sham Sweets and Pastries. Tala told me the place is famous for its kanafeh, a sweet and cheesy pastry that some say originated in Nablus and comes soaked in simple syrup and often is studded with pistachios. You can get your kanafeh soft here (it looks like flan, but it's chewy like mozzarella) or topped with a crunchy shell. Or do what I did, and get both. About $7 worth of both soft and crispy kanafeh. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Look at all that baklava! (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Maybe even better, though, is Al-Sham's baklava, which comes in at least a half dozen different varieties. Again, the proper order here is ""one of each."" Wolf them down out on the sidewalk, getting your fingers increasingly sticky with every bite. About $6 worth of assorted baklava. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Al-Sham Sweets and Pastries is located at 24-39 Steinway Street, just north of 25th Avenue, and is currently open from 11 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. daily. Already a user?

El Sazon Brings Superb Dominican Smashburgers and Perfect Pernil to Chinatown,https://hellgatenyc.com/el-sazon-superb-dominican-smashburgers-perfect-pernil-chinatown-nyc-review,83 Baxter Street,El Sazon (https://www.instagram.com/elsazon_rd83/),"83+Baxter+Street,+NYC",El Sazon,40.7166726,-73.9996701,https://www.instagram.com/elsazon_rd83/,,,,"Baxter Street below Canal is pretty much a disaster of a construction zone these days, and will remain so for god knows how many more years, thanks to the building of the world's tallest jail that is engulfing this part of Chinatown. But for now at least, a few signs of neighborhood life remain on the west side of the street, where phở shops and counter-service spots have long served up decent cheap eats amid the nail spas and bail bond storefronts. A couple of months ago, a newcomer joined the fray—El Sazon, a classic Dominican steam-table joint with a somewhat unexpected twist. It took over the space from Breakroom (once semi-famous for the innumerable bottles of hot sauce that lined its walls), and, in addition to piling platters high with the likes of chicharrones de pollo and carne guisada, it sells a superb smashburger, done up with Dominican flair. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The El Sazon burger is actually ""smashed"" less than its many, many contemporaries—it vibes more diner-style than, say, what George Motz is doing over in Soho—but the beef, via Pat LaFrieda, has a good, juicy funk to it, so that's a bonus in my book. I got a double, which makes for a beast of a sandwich, and it comes topped with melted American cheese; thick pickle slices; lots of punchy chimichurri, or chimi, sauce; and, for two bucks more, an impressive slab of fried queso blanco. Double Dominican smashburger, $10, with optional (but highly recommended) fried cheese, $2. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The burger seems destined to become the fan favorite at El Sazon, but the more traditional Dominican dishes will make you happy (and very full) as well. The pernil, for example, was delicious, a pile of hacked-up roasted pork shoulder featuring plenty of crackling skin, chewy fat, and juicy chunks of meat. The beans and rice are great too. I had the $11.95 ""all day special"" size, and it was plenty of food for any meal. You can also get your pernil in a hero sandwich, paired with fried salami, sweet plantains, fried cheese, and some of that chimi sauce, which sounds like grounds for a serious nap. Other options in this category include a cheesesteak with mojo de ajo, and the meaty, messy riki taki with ground beef, two halves of a hardboiled egg, and lots of mayo and ketchup. Or wolf a big ball of mofongo, the mashed, fried green plantains studded with the meat of your choice (the chicken was good) and paired with a generous container of tomato shrimp sauce to dump all over everything. There are also ribs, and garlic shrimp platters, and loaded fries, and a full Dominican breakfast, aka ""tres golpes,"" with eggs, creamy mangú, and fried cheese and salami. Mofongo with chicken, $14. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) El Sazon is family-owned and operated. Bijo and Edwin Collado, a father-and-son team, are no strangers to Chinatown, having run the short-lived but well-regarded El Sitio over on Mulberry Street. For their new place, they've brought on their nephew/cousin, Ari Valerio. Most customers here get takeout, Valerio told me (it's a lot of courthouse and construction workers), though there are a few stools available in the utilitarian space. If it's nice out, the picnic tables at Columbus Park are less than a block away. El Sazon is located at 83 Baxter Street, between Bayard and Walker Streets, and is currently open on Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and on Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Already a user?

Nothing More Punk Than Slinging Delicious Vegan Southern Food at a Greenpoint Dive Bar,https://hellgatenyc.com/jjs-southern-vegan-the-drift-greenpoint-nyc-review,579 Meeker Avenue,"Suffocating Madness (https://suffocatingmadness.bandcamp.com/album/promo-tape), The Drift (https://www.instagram.com/thedriftbrooklyn/)","579+Meeker+Avenue,+NYC",Suffocating Madness,40.7215313,-73.9424809,https://suffocatingmadness.bandcamp.com/album/promo-tape,,,,"Jesse Lipper, the chef and co-owner of the terrific and literal hole-in-the-wall spot JJ's Southern Vegan, grew up in Atlanta and, as he put it, spent ""pretty much all of my early adult life"" cooking in restaurants. He switched over to carpentry as a profession after a while, moved up here to Bed-Stuy, and settled into a life of playing guitar in a bunch of punk bands including Stigmatism and Suffocating Madness . Jolene Mattison, Lipper's fellow chef and co-owner at JJ's and Lipper's partner in life, grew up in upstate New York and, while she had never had a restaurant job before, she told Hell Gate that ""I've always really liked feeding people."" Mattison continued, ""We've been in the punk music scene for so long and friends are always rolling through, crashing at our house, and they're always hungry. So it was fun for me to go crazy making big breakfasts for everyone. That's me translating how I care for people: 'Hey I made you this.'"" Jolene Mattison, ready to take your order. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) How Mattison and Lipper traded in (some of) their punk rock life for slinging vegan Southern food seven nights a week at the back of The Drift, a divey bar in Greenpoint owned by the Commodore folks, is a pandemic story. Early on, when grocery stores were some of the only things open, Mattison spied some hen of the woods mushrooms and challenged Lipper to make them for dinner. ""He's the fry master,"" she said. ""And he was like, 'I know how to do this, let's make it taste like chicken.' It was amazing, so we started doing pop-ups with it at our friends' bars, because they needed to sell food with drinks back then."" Lipper added, ""It was a side hustle during quarantine to keep us from going crazy. And now, here we are running a restaurant. It just kind of happened."" All of which is excellent news for the rest of us, because in addition to being just very cool and decent human beings, Mattison and Lipper also really know how to cook. The menu at JJ's Southern Vegan, which opened at The Drift last October, features about a half-dozen versions of the couple's awesome ""chicken fried hen of the woods"" sandwiches, including a glorious Buffalo beast, which arrives dripping with hot sauce and homemade ranch dressing, the battered and fried fungi punched up with a pile of pickled celery. JJ's vegan hot chicken sandwich, $13. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The JJ's hot chicken sandwich is, indeed, quite spicy, thanks to the generously applied seasoning and some kicky remoulade. The ""Regina,"" which comes with a bunch of coleslaw on top, and the ""deluxe,"" with fake cheddar, are among the other sandwich options. JJ's sides bring a lot to the party here as well. I had the smoky collards (lovely) and the mac and cheese (creamy and comforting), but the fried pickles and the mashed potatoes with gravy also sound like equally worthy accompaniments. Mac and cheese, $10, collard greens, $7. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) You order from a cutout window in The Drift's back room, right by the pool table, and you get one of those number flags to plant wherever you're sitting. Either Lipper or Mattison will bring your food to you when it's done. The Drift's vibe is pretty punk, music-wise, which fits with JJ's, and the decor is very ""is this the 1970s or does it just look like Ohio,"" to paraphrase Alex Rapine's recent treatise on the subject. ""It's been really rewarding,"" said Mattison. ""I knew that making food and feeding people was something that I liked to do, but I never thought I could do it in a real-world setting. So that's really nice. It's also nice to use vegetables in a different way, but still respect them as vegetables. It's not 'fake meat,' it's a mushroom."" And, I'll just add, it's also delicious. JJ's Southern Vegan is located at the back of The Drift , 579 Meeker Avenue, between North Henry and Monitor Streets, and is currently open daily from 5 p.m. to midnight.

What to Eat (and What to Avoid) at Citi Field This Year,https://hellgatenyc.com/food-mets-citi-field-2024-review,123-01 Roosevelt Avenue,Citi Field Food Vendors (https://hellgatenyc.com/food-mets-citi-field-2023),"123-01+Roosevelt+Avenue,+NYC",Citi Field Food Vendors,40.7564124,-73.8458937,https://hellgatenyc.com/food-mets-citi-field-2023,,,,"Does rooting for the Mets really feel like getting run over by a truck ? I honestly don't know. I picked my team, the Yankees, in the early 1970s—the Celerino Sánchez era—because they were my dad's team, and so have ridden that road full of chumps and champs in equal measure, ever since. Here's what I do know, though: Every spring, the PR and marketing teams at Citi Field throw an excellent party to showcase everything that's new to a packed house of media folks and various high-powered influencers, and it's a blast. You get to walk around the empty stadium, they play the peppiest bangers imaginable, there's decent swag, and most of the day is spent eating just a stupid amount of food. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) I went to Citi Field's ""New in 2024"" affair last week, and on the eve of the Mets home opener , which will surely kick off a season in which they will tear through the league on their way to a World Series title, I present to you a non-exhaustive look at what culinary delights await you, the long-suffering Mets fan, at the stadium this year. Note: Most dishes at the party were served in sample sizes, and had been sitting under heat lamps for an undetermined amount of time before we snatched them up. Also, prices were not revealed, so in keeping with ballpark traditions everywhere, everything will likely cost at least four dollars more than you want it to. First, the good. There are some new celebrity chefs lending their licensed image here at Citi Field in '24 and, somewhat surprisingly given her spotty track record in the Big Apple, one of the best things I ate on media day came from Anne Burrell's Italian Eats stand —a boat of ""loaded pepperoni chips"" which essentially treated a bunch of thick slabs of the crisp-fried sausage as nachos, piling on things like provolone cheese sauce, pickled onions, and hot cherry peppers. This was fun and delicious. Want to read the freshest, most incisive coverage of New York City? Join the 15,000+ New Yorkers who already love our free newsletter, Inbox Hell, sent out every Wednesday and Saturday—click here to sign up today. The ""Juicy Lucy"" double burger from Adam Richman. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Adam ""Man v. Food"" Richman is also on celebrity row, with a messy, meaty ""Juicy Lucy"" double burger oozing cheese and drenched in French onion soup. Shake Shack delivered the goods with a new to Citi Field (and uninspiringly named) ""Chicken Shack,"" which nailed the crisp coating/juicy inside required for a successful fried bird sandwich, and came topped with enough pickles and mayo to bring both an acidic bite and fatty gloppiness to the proceedings. Shake Shack rocks and deals a winner with this fried chicken sandwich. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The family-owned Astoria crowd-pleaser Comfortland arrived ready for an early season run (through May 14) at the ""Coca-Cola Truck"" in right field. They'll be slinging a decadent brisket sandwich with balsamic fried onions and melted gruyère. Another brisket-based winner: Pig Beach 's smoky beef and BBQ sauce ladled atop a mound of gooey mac and cheese. Brisket sandwich from Comfortland. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Chiddy's Cheesesteaks busted out their ridiculously large ""Chiddy Dog,"" a foot-long covered in steak crumbles, jalapeños, and melted Cheez Whiz. I liked this a lot, but my stomach was happy that I didn't eat the whole thing. Chiddy's monster dog. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Less successful were the slices, both the pepperoni-laden square and the oversized regular, from Prince Street Pizza , which were slathered in a sauce so sugary they almost functioned as dessert. Even sweeter (and equally unappealing after a single bite) was the Wok n' Roll rainbow cookie egg roll with chocolate sauce, the Long Island-based shop clearly just gunning for a viral hit with this one. The Prince Street Pizza is super sugary. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Three local restaurants will take turns selling their wares in the ""Taste of Queens"" subsection of the ""Taste of the City"" section at field-level, starting with teriyaki chicken skewers laid across egg fried rice from Poprice , whose regular location is a stand inside the Union Mall in Fresh Meadows. Jerk chicken burgers from Jamaica's RyRy's Kitchen will follow at the end of May, and a classic Cuban sandwich from Benny's Cuban Cafe of Ridgewood will arrive in July to close out the season. ""I'm a product of a Brooklyn family, born and raised in Bushwick, and my dad's a big Mets fan, we're all big Mets fans, and this is amazing,"" said Mike Lopez, the chef and owner of Benny's. ""We're a small mom-and-pop operation, so it's really super exciting to be at Citi Field."" Some other, not-food news: All Saturday games will start at either 1 p.m. or 4 p.m. (so maybe just go eat dinner somewhere along the 7 train on the way home); promo days include both Darryl Strawberry and Dwight Gooden bobblehead giveaways, and there's also a pickleball paddle (shudder) day; and 30 games will feature an incredible new dance team/cheer squad called the Queens Crew, who will roam the stadium throughout the game hyping up some serious party vibes. The Mets's new hype team, the Queens Crew. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Finally, there are now, at long last, two Citi Bike docks located at Citi Field, though be warned: As of now, these are not those ""valet docks"" able to accept an unlimited number of bikes, so you might show up at the stadium and have nowhere to park.

Make Your Way to Sunnyside’s Newa Chhe For Fantastic Nepali Delights,https://hellgatenyc.com/newa-chhe-kathmandu-valley-nepali-sunnyside-queens-review,4301 Queens Boulevard,Newa Chhe (https://newachhe.com/),"4301+Queens+Boulevard,+NYC",Newa Chhe,40.7437961,-73.9212204,https://newachhe.com/,,,,"The four longtime friends who opened the terrific Newa Chhe on Queens Boulevard in Sunnyside last December have a specific vision for their restaurant. ""We want to serve only Nepalese dishes here,"" Radip Shrestha told Hell Gate. ""No Indian stuff, no Chinese stuff. Only things from the Newar people of the Kathmandu Valley,"" where he and his partners are originally from. But even in these famously multilingual and culinarily adventurous precincts of western Queens, Shrestha admits that some of the dishes at Newa Chhe are a tough sell, most notably those in the ""Newa Exotic Food"" section of the menu. To wit: the nhepu fry, the jibro fry, and the tauko fry, or goat brain, goat tongue, and goat head. ""We're having a hard time serving it every night,"" Shrestha said. ""We are purchasing five heads at a time, and since, you know, a goat has only one tongue, not two, there are only five orders available, and we don't know how many or how fast they will go."" (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) According to Shrestha, the menu is subject to change. ""We've been open since December 10 but haven't printed our paper menu yet,"" he said, ""because we're not sure what the restaurant will be. We don't want to print out five, 10 boxes of the wrong thing."" My advice to you, then, is to get over to Newa Chhe as soon as possible, both to support the endeavor and, more important, to eat some of their excellent food. The goat head fry, for example, was one of the best things I've had this year, heavily seasoned with ginger and garlic and so fatty and funky and tender. Tauko fry (goat head), $14. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Water buffalo also has a large presence on the Newa Chhe menu. You can get the beast prepared as jerky, or stuffed inside some thick-skinned momos, or fried into a green lentil pancake known as a bara. This latter format makes for an excellent snack, especially after spooning on the robust (and unexpectedly spicy) tamarind sauce that comes with it. Bara (green lentil pancake) with water buffalo, $10. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Or get the buffalo choila—basically, a bowl of chopped-up, well-marinated meat, served chilled—as the centerpiece of a samay baji platter, which features an abundance of other wonderful things, including chiura, crunchy rice that's been beaten flat; alu, a potato dish; and bhuti, a bean dish. My table's neighbors got the $50 ""serves three"" version of this, and it looked like a total party. Samay baji platter with water buffalo, $16. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) If chicken's more your thing, the bird can be subbed in for goat or water buffalo in most of the above offerings. There's also a bright orange, legitimately fiery ""chicken chillis"" dish, as well as a sautéed gizzard concoction called pangra. There's booze here, too: Cocktails are $15 (spicy mango margarita alert!), bottles of wine run in the low $30s, and a bucket of bottled beers will set you back $35. Chicken chillis, $12. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Chhe means ""house,"" by the way, and Shrestha and his partners Buay Khayargoli, Kunchok Sherpa, and Pashupati Shrestha have done a good job of creating a chill haven on the bustling boulevard—they were going for ""rooftop garden"" with all those wooden slats—without, as Shrestha put, ""making the place into a museum."" This restaurant is great—let's hope it stays. Newa Chhe is located at 4301 Queens Boulevard, at the corner of 43rd Street, and is currently open on Monday through Thursday from noon to 10 p.m. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Already a user?

ThisBowl Conquers Noho With the Antithesis of the Sad Desk Salad,https://hellgatenyc.com/thisbowl-noho-bondi-lunch-review,65 Bleecker Street,ThisBowl (),"65+Bleecker+Street,+NYC",ThisBowl,40.7264239,-73.994992,https://www.instagram.com/willett/?hl=en,,,,"Something kind of remarkable is happening these days down near the eastern end of Bleecker Street. About six weeks ago, three guys from Sydney, Australia—Nathan Dalah, Nic Pestalozzi, and Casper Ettelson—opened a salad/rice bowl shop in Noho called ThisBowl. Now, in a part of town lousy with Sweetgreens and Chop'ts, fancy health food spots like Honeybrains, plus juice bars galore, this did not immediately strike me as breaking news. In fact, when I first saw the signage go up over the winter, I texted my daughter who lives in Sydney. She filled me in, a bit unenthused: ""Yeah, they're everywhere here, like a lunch spot or whatever."" What a line! (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) So I was somewhat surprised on ThisBowl's opening day when these three affable Aussies were greeted with a line that extended well down the block and didn't let up until closing time. Even more surprising, there's been a line out the door at ThisBowl every day since then. We’re talking all day long, and into the night, with no downtime. For six weeks straight! And you can't really blame Instagram or TikTok for this one. No matter how thoughtfully composed they are, bowls of salad just aren't that drool-worthy. Here's the thing, though: Dalah, Pestalozzi, and Ettelson have been honing their healthy bowl game for almost eight years now, growing that first, 280-square-foot shack in Bondi Beach into an epic 47-shop empire in Sydney, Melbourne, and Queensland. They really know what they're doing. ""We always liked hospitality and the idea of creating spaces that people could enjoy,"" Pestalozzi told Hell Gate. ""We wanted to bring an atmosphere of fun and excitement to eating healthy food. We also really liked the idea of making quality food accessible. I could never really understand why it was so hard to get a healthy meal at a decent price."" The O.G. bowl with salmon sushi, $16.40 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The big thing the team did change for this, their first American venture, was the name, going from Fishbowl (everywhere in Australia) to ThisBowl (NYC and whatever may come next). ""Fishbowl was a good name seven or eight years ago, when that was more reflective of the product that we were serving,"" Pestalozzi said. ""But today it's too suggestive of what we're not. Basically, if you tell someone the name Fishbowl, they think they know what it is before they've even tried it. But if you tell them ThisBowl, it means nothing. It's a terrible name until you experience what it is. And then it means something to you and you go 'yeah, ThisBowl's awesome .'"" And he's right. ThisBowl is, indeed, awesome. The menu leads with a five-step build-a-bowl section, but that involves way too many decisions for me to deal with. These guys are the pros! Let them figure out my meal! For that, there are nine different fully composed ""house favorites,"" where all you have to do is choose your base: sushi rice, brown rice, shredded cabbage, or mixed leaves. The braised beef bowl, $15.90 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) I tried three of these last Friday afternoon and really enjoyed them all. My favorite was the braised beef on cabbage and brown rice, which, in addition to its impressive pile of shredded, well-marinated meat, co-starred things like sweet potato, kale, wasabi mayo, chili, and—key capper—an umami nut crunch. It tasted great, featured a nice variety of textures and flavors, totally worked as a complete, ample meal, and made me feel virtuous. That beef was so good, it made me wish I had also ordered something with chicken, but my ""O.G."" bowl on sushi rice, with salmon sashimi, tobiko, edamame, beets, seaweed, avocado, and sansho crispy crunch, was also pretty rad. There are a couple of vegetarian/vegan house favorites too, like a miso eggplant beauty on brown rice with roasted tofu, ginger, and several other things already mentioned above. And if your bowl doesn't include the house made chili jam as one its core ingredients, spend an extra buck for a little crock on the side. It definitely brings a welcome bit of zing to the party. Good vibes. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ThisBowl is a counter-service restaurant, and the operation here is friendly, responsive, fast, and smooth. Despite the crowds, the wait time from when you first get on line to when you pick up your order is surprisingly quick, with smart touches implemented along the way to speed things up, like serving everything ""to stay,"" but providing bowl lids and bags at a self-serve ""to go"" station if you want to pack it up yourself. There's seating for about 25 inside, at a big communal table and a bunch of two-tops along a baguette that can be reconfigured depending on your crew. As you would expect for a business launched in Bondi, the vibes are super chill, with a trip-hoppy soundtrack and a contemporary design by Ben Willett that highlights a bunch of specially commissioned art. My theory: Other than the quality of food itself, a good part of ThisBowl's appeal, especially to the cool kids and gym junkies of Noho, is that in no way does it feel like you're settling for a sad desk salad here. Slammed at 3 p.m. on a Friday. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""I love New York,"" said Pestalozzi. ""I've met more people here in the last three weeks than I met in the last three years. Everyone sort of questioned us, like, 'why do you want to go to New York, the most competitive place in the world? Why don't you go to L.A. first, or London?' But New York is the mecca, the center of everything. If we get New York right, we can go anywhere. Dive in the deep end first, and then the world's kind of your oyster."" ThisBowl is located at 65 Bleecker Street, between Broadway and Lafayette, and is currently open from 11:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. daily. Already a user? Log in Thanks for reading!

Curry Mee Is Your New Go-To For Malaysian Food in Park Slope,https://hellgatenyc.com/curry-mee-park-slope,"369 Fifth Avenue, Brooklyn",Curry Mee (https://www.yelp.com/biz/curry-mee-brooklyn),369+Fifth+Avenue%2C+Brooklyn,Curry Mee,40.671156,-73.9843551,,,,,"Joe Liao grew up on Grand and Eldridge Streets in Chinatown, and worked for 20 years at the pioneering Thai noodle spot Republic (RIP) in Union Square. Today, he lives in Bayside, Queens with his wife and kids. So why is Curry Mee, Liao's first-ever solo restaurant, located amid the retail clutter of Fifth Avenue in Park Slope? And why does it feature a mostly Malaysian menu? It's a family thing. ""My wife Sandia is from Malaysia,"" Liao told Hell Gate. ""She insisted the city needs more good Malaysian food, and daughter goes to high school right down the block, so I've gotten to know Park Slope pretty well. The people are nice here!"" There you have it. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The full spread. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Malaysian classics like nasi lemak are the heart of Curry Mee's menu. The version here includes a saucy chicken stew, some chewy dried anchovies (also, somewhat unusually, in a sauce), plus peanuts, cucumber, and a boiled egg, all surrounding a mound of coconut rice. It may lack the punch of some of the best versions of this dish around town—everything here feels slightly toned down for the Park Slope crowd—but the side of house-made sambal, which arrives at your table unbidden, is fiery and funky as hell. Spoon it on with abandon. Nasi lemak, $12.95. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) A surprise winner at Curry Mee (that I'm fairly certain I would have ignored if Chris Crowley's buddies hadn't extolled its virtues ) is the ""crunch okra,"" a dish Liao says he ""invented because Park Slope people like vegetables."" It's excellent fried okra: light, snappy, not slimy, and great for dipping. Definitely get this for the table. Crunch okra, $11 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) I never ignore chow fun on any menu, so I tried Curry Mee's char kway teow, the Malaysian version of those loaded-up, wok-fried rice noodles. It had lots of shrimp, squid, and hunks of pork. It needed some perking up with the house chili sauce, but it satisfied my near-constant craving for something greasy, starchy, and rich. It seemed ridiculous to go to a restaurant called Curry Mee and not get the curry mee (aka Malaysian noodle soup) which comes in multiple varieties: beef stew, seafood, vegetarian, and my choice, chicken. This has a nice little kick to it; the bird is tender and gamey, the egg noodles abundant and slippery. Combined with that okra and eaten out back in the yard, it makes for a fine summer supper. Malaysian chow fun, $13.95 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Curry chicken mee, $12.95 (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) There are plenty of all-purpose crowd pleasers on the menu here as well, including various kinds of satay, chicken wings, pineapple fried rice, pad Thai, crispy wontons, and Hainanese chicken with rice. Buckets of beer (five bottles, mix-and-match from the likes of Tiger, Singha, and Lucky Buddha) will cost you $20; glasses of wine are $8. See? Great backyard! (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Curry Mee takes over the space on Fifth Avenue from a mildly regarded ramen spot called Menya & Izakaya, which closed in February after a two-year run. Design-wise, Liao changed little besides the exterior signage and the stickers plastered to the tables in the pretty back garden. The Great Wave off Kanagawa , for example, still roars behind the bar. One welcome improvement: There are actual chairs with backs in the dining room now, instead of those squat little stools. Curry Mee is located 369 Fifth Avenue, between Fifth and Sixth Streets, and is currently open on Sunday through Tuesday, and Thursday, from 11:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., and on Friday and Saturday from 11:00 to 10:00.

Emeye Ethiopian Cuisine’s Exceptional Food Is Your Perfect Park Meal This Summer,https://hellgatenyc.com/emeye-ethiopian-cuisine-injera-yum-nyc,"Columbus Circle, Manhattan",Emeye Ethiopian (https://www.instagram.com/emeye_ethiopiancuisine/),Columbus+Circle%2C+Manhattan,Emeye Ethiopian,40.767848,-73.9815219,,,,,"I've been eating Ferehiwot Sheffield's sega wat for almost two years now, ever since we first met in the fall of 2022 at her Emeye Ethiopian Cuisine tent at the Queens Night Market. It was love at first bite between me and the mound of incredibly rich, complex, and legit spicy beef stew that Sheffield serves with vegetables atop a semicircle of spongy injera. It's an incredible plate of food. I've had the sega wat at Emeye at least three times since then, but only recently did Sheffield school me on exactly why her version of this dish, which is as common in her native city of Addis Ababa as, say, cheeseburgers are here, is so unusually delicious—and distinct from any other you're likely to find in New York City. Sheffield preparing my delicious plate of sega wat. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) ""When I moved here in 2012, first in Red Hook and now in Sunnyside, it was so hard for me to find, not Ethiopian food in general because there's a lot of that, but real injera,"" Sheffield told Hell Gate. ""In Ethiopia, injera is made only with teff, which is a grain. We don't mix it with anything. It's healthier and it's gluten-free. If you mix it with wheat flour, which is what most restaurants here do, it's more like eating bread. With only teff flour, it just tastes better. It tastes like home."" Sheffield told me it took her about seven years to master making her teff-only injera in New York City—something about the water here just makes it really difficult, she said—but as far as I'm concerned, speaking as someone who delights in tearing off chunks of the stuff to scoop up mouthfuls of meat, it was worth the effort. Mango and avocado spris, $13. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The other secret to Emeye's exceptional wat (there's a vegan version too, misir wat, made with red lentils), was easier for Sheffield to come by—she just had to ask her mom. ""In Ethiopia, every family has their own recipe for berbere, which is our chili powder. It takes more than 12 spices to make, and my mom is very, very famous back home for her berbere. She puts a lot of love into it. That's why the wat tastes so good."" She serves her great teff injera and the lovely spicy stew (beef or lentil) with three scoops of different vegetable dishes, which change depending on what Sheffield feels like cooking. Last Sunday in Prospect Park at Emeye's Smorgasburg stand, that meant creamy yellow split peas; a bright, chunky beetroot salad; and a crunchy slaw made with cabbage and carrots. Mitmita fries, $8; lentil sambusa with jalapeño dip, two for $10; mango and avocado spris, $13. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) The Emeye summer menu has some snacky things on it as well, including first-rate, flaky sambusas stuffed with well-seasoned black lentils and accompanied by a fiery jalapeño dip, and a boatload of thick fries dusted with an Ethiopian spice blend called mitmita. Definitely squirt a bunch of Sheffield's homemade spicy mayo all over these babies. There's also some Ethiopian-style beverages debuting this season, including a honey drink called birz, and spris, a super-thick, smoothie-ish cup of mango and avocado. As far as vibes go, all three of Emeye's locations from now through the fall—Saturdays at the Queens Night Market, Sundays at Smorgasburg, and the first Tuesday of the month at the Vegan Night Market in Columbus Circle—are in or near parks, so you're basically here for a picnic. Smorgasburg vibes. (Scott Lynch / Hell Gate) Sheffield hopes these stands are just the start of the Emeye story. ""My goal is to open a restaurant somewhere, hopefully in Sunnyside. We're working on it. This is just to introduce ourselves, and get our name out there. We put our hearts into this. My friends tell me I cook for Emeye like I cook for my home. And it's not about the business, really. I didn't start Emeye to own something. I wanted people to experience Ethiopian culture and Ethiopian food. You see people eat this, and they are so happy."" Emeye Ethiopian Cuisine can be found on Saturdays starting at 4 p.m. at the Queens Night Market , on Sundays starting at 11 a.m. at Smorgasburg in Prospect Park, and on the first Tuesday every month starting at 2 p.m. at the Vegan Night Market in Columbus Circle.

It's an unexpected New York City micro-trend that I fully support—in fact, I'd go so far as to say that gas stations in general should ditch their whole ""fossil fuels"" thing entirely and focus solely on feeding first-rate munchies to afternoon stoners and late-night fiends. The city would be a happier place. The latest entrant into our Great Gas Station Restaurant Summer is a terrific new halal joint called Blue Hour, located inside the BP station at one of those chaotic three-way intersections along Myrtle Avenue in Bushwick. Drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians are all welcome; the actual entrance sits just off Grove Street and is readily accessible via the sidewalk. Blue Hour's four owners—Ali Zaman, Mohamed Ghiasi, Devlin Claro, and Yusuf Zaman—are seasoned industry pros (Little Flower Cafe in Astoria and Dunya Kabab House in Kensington are among their various other establishments), and you get a level of hospitality here not usually seen in a space otherwise dominated by a lottery vending machine.

NYC’s Best Taqueria Ups Their Taco Game With the New Carnitas Ramirez,https://hellgatenyc.com/carnitas-ramirez-nyc-alphabet-city-review,"210 East Third Street, Manhattan",Carnitas Ramirez (https://www.instagram.com/carnitasramireznyc/?ref=hellgatenyc.com),210+East+Third+Street%2C+Manhattan,Carnitas Ramirez,40.7224688,-73.9827999,,,,,"Tania Apolinar and Giovanni Cervantes didn't plan on becoming New York City taco heroes. But when the photography studio where they worked got shut down during the pandemic, they knew they had to shift gears, and fast. Cervantes grew up in Mexico City, and Apolinar is from Torreón, in northern Mexico, and so they thought, why not open a taqueria ? Taqueria Ramirez, their tiny shop on residential Oak Street in Greenpoint, opened in September of 2021—and it's a career move for which the rest of us are forever grateful. Now, Cervantes told Hell Gate, their taqueria serves more than 2,000 unapologetically CDMX-style tacos a day—think cuts of cow like tripa and suadero burbling away in lard for hours before getting plopped onto your tortillas. Add an al pastor beauty and a funky little chorizo number to the mix, and you've got the best taco spot in town . A couple of years ago, though, Apolinar and Cervantes began itching to expand into Manhattan, preferably downtown. While their first thought was simply to open a sort of cut-and-paste version of their taqueria, they also weren't interested in creating some sort of scalable chain. ""Me and Tania were like, how are we going to do this without abandoning our original project?"" said Cervantes. ""And how can we make this possible in the most humane, realistic, and fun way for us and our team?"" Their solution was two-fold. First, they partnered with another couple, Kari Boden and Yvon de Tassigny, the latter a long-time chef at Fette Sau and St. Anselm (""Meat has been my thing for some time,"" said de Tassigny), and the former a seasoned front-of-house pro. Second, just to keep things interesting, they decided to ditch their taqueria menu and go all in on pig: ears, snout, tongue, cheek, butt, stomach, brains, and tail. The whole hog, so to speak. Thus was born Carnitas Ramirez, my favorite new restaurant of the year. Located right off Avenue B on East Third Street, Carnitas Ramirez only serves, you guessed it, carnitas tacos, which here means cooking all of those pig parts together in a big vat of lard. The only seasonings are salt and a bit of garlic. You choose your cut (just look at the steam table or check out the pig anatomy sketch that someone drew onto a mirror), and Cervantes and de Tassigny hack it into pieces and plop it onto a corn tortilla. Further toppings are up to you: There are two kinds of salsas (red and green, both lively and delicious), pickled onions, and a chunky jalapeño mix in big bowls near the register as well as in cute little containers on the tables in the back room. ""One of my best friends is from Michoacán, which is known for its carnitas,"" said Cervantes. ""When we were deciding to do this, I had a chance to go and he showed me, this is the way we do it here . It's very minimal. The tricky part is getting to know the meats, in terms of the times and temperature they need to be inside the pot."" Well, they nailed it. I've eaten at least six or seven different tacos so far at Carnitas Ramirez and loved every one. It's impossible to choose favorites. The offal is all terrific, especially the oreja (ears), lengua (tongue), and trompa (snout). Right now, the sesos (brains) is only available as a special and inside a mini empanada of sorts called a sesadilla, but it too is delicious. Cervantes said they're still working on a source for matriz (uterus), which real carnitas devotees say is the best one. ""We want to make this a proper Mexican experience,"" said de Tassigny, ""and not just serve what you usually get in New York as burrito or taco meat."" What I call the ""gringo cuts""—maciza (a mix of loin, leg, and shoulder), costilla (ribs), and buche (stomach)—are equally excellent. If you're uncertain how to round out your order (three or four tacos here make for a satisfying meal), just order a surtida, a sort of ""chef's choice"" assortment, and Cervantes and de Tassigny will pile on a combo of items for you. No matter what, I recommend getting a side of their chicharrón, or fried skin, which gets strewn on top. There is one vegan option, a taco with rajas con papa (chilis and potatoes), that I hear is good. As at Taqueria, there's no takeout available unless you bring your own container. But you can buy a pound of whatever meats you want for $60, an order that also comes with enough tortillas to make your own tacos (help yourself to the toppings bar, too). Unlike at Taqueria, you can get beer ($7) and wine ($10) at Carnitas. Mexican Coke, Topo Chico, and pour-your-own cups of water are also available. Either way, though, don't linger. Even though there are about 20 seats in the back room (where telenovelas play on a janky old TV), and space for another 10 guests at stools on either side of the big front window, you should still be considerate. Eat and leave to give other people a chance to gorge on all that carnitas. ""It's been a life-changing thing, these restaurants,"" said Cervantes. ""It's hard to remember our lives before the taqueria. We've been so deep into this, and you end up understanding that it's not just a job, it really becomes your life. I'm happy with that, happy that we built a really good team. It feels strong. We like each other. I feel really good about that, to walk into Taqueria and now Carnitas and feel the energy of the people."" Carnitas Ramirez is located at 210 East Third Street, just east of Avenue B, and is currently open from noon to 10 p.m. on Friday, from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Saturday, and from noon to 9 p.m. on Sunday, with more days to come.","Learn why Carnitas Ramirez, located in Alphabet City, is our $20 Dinner columnist's favorite new restaurant of 2024.",Scott Lynch,"June 27, 2024",
